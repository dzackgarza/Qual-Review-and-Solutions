# Topics and Remarks


:::{.remark}
(DZG) on the structure of these notes: these are *extremely* disorganized at the moment, and only reflect some amalgamation of all of the random notes I made to myself while studying for qualifying exams.
As a result, things are bound to be out of order, and likely useless pedagogically unless you've seen most of the material before.
Moreover, this has been a long-running document (started in my undergrad years, so pre-2018), and since I've forgotten and rewritten certain things at various points, there may even be duplicated material (e.g. propositions stated/proved in multiple places, repeated exercises or statements, etc).

In any case, I'd love to hear if you do find it useful!
Readers are welcome to email me with any questions, comments, errors/typos, suggestions for improvement, or just to say hello! 😄

"As a general rule, students are responsible for knowing both the theory (proofs) and practical
applications (e.g. **how to find the Jordan or rational canonical form** of a given matrix, **or the Galois group of a given polynomial**) of the topics mentioned."

# Group Theory

:::{.remark}
Summary of useful qual tips:

- Slightly obvious but good to remember:
  - Subgroups of abelian groups are automatically normal.
  - If $N$ is normal in $G$, then $N$ is normal in any subgroup containing it.
  - If $N\leq G$ is the unique group of order $\# N$, then $N$ is normal (since any conjugate must have the same size).
  - Using the subgroup correspondence: if $L/H\leq G/H$ then $L\leq G$ has size $\#(L/H)\#H$.
- Sizes and structure:
  - Quotienting by bigger groups yields smaller indices:
  \[
  1 \leq H \leq H \leq K \leq G \quad\text{ apply} [G: \wait] &&\implies \# G = [G:1] \geq [G:H] \geq [G:K] \geq [G:G] = 1
  .\]
  - $x$ is central iff $[x] = \ts{e}$.
  - Unions aren't (generally) subgroups, intersections always are.
  - Coprime order subgroups intersect trivially.
  - Distinct subgroups of order $p^n, p^m$ can intersect trivially *or* in subgroups of order $p^{\ell}$.
- Conjugacy:
  - Sizes of conjugacy classes divide $\# G$ (by orbit-stabilizer).
  - Conjugate subgroups have equal cardinality.
  - Normal subgroups absorb conjugacy classes, and are thus unions of conjugacy classes.
  - Reasoning about conjugacy classes: in $S_n$ they're precisely determined by cycle type, i.e. a partition of $n$.
  - Remembering the class equation: for literally any group action $\phi: G\actson X$, one has $X = \Fix(\phi) \disjoint' \Orb(x_i)$ as a disjoint union of fixed points and nontrivial orbits, since orbits partition $X$.
    Then take your action to be $G\actson G$ by $\phi: g.x\da gxg\inv$ to get $\Fix(\phi) = Z(G)$ and $\Orb(x_i) = \ts{gx_ig\inv} = [x_i]$ the conjugacy classes.
    Now apply orbit stabilizer to get $\Orb(x) \cong G/\Stab(x)$ where $\Stab(x) = Z(x) = C_G(x)$ the centralizer.
- Cosets:
  - Cosets partition a group.
  - Anything dealing with indices $[G:H]$: try just listing the cosets.
  - $aH = bH \iff ab\inv \in H$.
  - Showing subgroup containment: $K \subseteq H$ iff $kH = H$ for all $k\in K$.
- Sylows:
  - If $S_p$ is normal, then $S_p$ is characteristic.
    This is useful if $H\leq G$ and $P\in\Syl_p(H)$ is normal in $H$, then $P$ is also normal in $G$.

:::{.remark}
For any $p$ dividing the order of $G$, $\mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$ denotes the *set* of Sylow$\dash p$ subgroups of $G$.
:::




## Definitions

:::{.fact}
An set morphism that is *either* injective or surjective between sets of the same size is automatically a bijection.
It turns out that a group morphism between groups of the same size that is either injective or surjective is automatically a bijection, and the inverse is automatically a group morphism, so bijective group morphisms are isomorphisms.

:::

:::{.fact title="Bezout's Identity"}
If $a, b\in \ZZ$ with $\gcd(a, b) = d$, then there exist $s,t\in \ZZ$ such that
\[
as + bt = d
.\]

This $d$ can be computed using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

:::

:::{.remark}
Useful context clue!
In particular, this works when $a, b$ are coprime and $d=1$, since you can write $x^1 = x^{as + bt} = x^{as}x^{bt}$ to get interesting information about orders of elements.
If you see "coprime" in a finite group question, try the division algorithm.
:::

:::{.definition title="Order"}
The **order** of an element $g\in G$, denoted $n \da o(g)$, is the smallest $n\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$ such that $g^n = e$.
:::

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Show that the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group.
:::

:::{.definition title="Group Presentation"}
An expression of the form $G = \gens{S \st R}$ where $S$ is a set of elements and $R$ a set of words defining relations means that $G \da F[S] / \cl_n(R)$ where $F[S]$ is the free group on the set $S$ and $\cl_n(R)$ is the normal closure, the smallest normal subgroup of $F[S]$ containing $R$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Finding morphisms between presentations: if $G$ is presented with generators $g_i$ with relations $r_i$ and $H$ is any group containing elements $h_i$ also satisfying $r_i$, there is a group morphism
\[
\phi: G &\to H \\
g_i &\mapsto h_i \quad \forall i
.\]
Why this exists: the presentation yields a surjective morphism $\pi: F(g_i) \to G$ with $G\cong F(g_i) / \ker \pi$.
Define a map $\psi: F(g_i) \to H$ where $g_i\mapsto h_i$, then since the $h_i$ satisfy the relations $r_i$, $\ker \pi \subseteq \ker \psi$.
So $\psi$ factors through $\ker \pi$ yielding a morphism $F/\ker \pi \to H$.
:::

## Subgroups

:::{.definition title="Subgroup"}
A subset $H\subseteq G$ is a **subgroup** iff

## Conjugacy

$[e] = \ts{ e }$ is always in a conjugacy class of size one -- this is useful for counting and divisibility arguments.
Conjugacy classes are **not** subgroups in general, since they don't generally contain $e$.
However, by orbit-stabilizer and the conjugation action, their sizes always divide the order of $G$.

**Useful qual fact**: $[x] = \ts{ x } \iff x\in Z(G)$, i.e. having a trivial conjugacy class is the same as being central.

> Hint: consider the intersection and count.
> Try Orbit-stabilizer?

:::

:::{.solution}
Strategy: bound the cardinality.
All conjugates of $H$ have the same cardinality, say $\# H = m$.
Suppose there are $n$ distinct conjugates of $H$.
Then they intersect only at the identity, so count their elements:
\[
\# \Union_{g\in G} gHg\inv = 1 + n(m-1)
.\]
Use that $n = [G: N_G(H)]$ by Orbit-Stabilizer, and $N_G(H) \leq G \implies n \leq n' \da [G:H]$.
Now note $n'm = \# H[G:H] = \# G$ by Lagrange:
\[
\# \Union_{g\in G} gHg\inv 
&= 1 + n(m-1) \\
&\leq 1 + n'(m-1) \\
&= 1 + n'm -n' \\
&= 1 + \# G - n' \\

### Normal Subgroups

:::{.definition title="Normal subgroup"}
A subgroup $N\leq G$ is **normal** iff $gH = Hg$ for every $g\in G$, or equivalently $gHg\inv = H$ for all $g$, so $H$ has only itself as a conjugate.
We denote this by $N\normal G$.
Equivalently, for every inner automorphism $\psi \in \Inn(G)$, $\psi(N) = N$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Normal iff disjoint union of conjugacy classes"}
$N\normal G \iff N = \disjoint' [h_i]$ is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes, where the index set for this union is one $h_i$ from each conjugacy class.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Note that $C(h_i) = \ts{ gh_i g\inv \st g\in G }$, and $gh_i g\inv \in H$ since $H$ is normal, so $C(h_i) \subseteq G$ for all $i$.
Conversely, if $C(h_i) \subseteq H$ for all $h_i \in H$, then $gh_ig\inv \in H$ for all $i$ and $H$ is normal.

:::

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Prove that if $G$ is a $p\dash$group, every subgroup $N\normal G$ intersects the center $Z(G)$.

> Hint: use the class equation.

:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

Easy solution:

- Use that $\# H \mod p = 1$ since $H\leq G$ and $G$ is a $p\dash$group.
- Then use that $H$ is a union of conjugacy classes, and since $e\in H$ there is at least one class of size 1, so
\[
\# H = \# \disjoint' [h_i] = \# [e] + \sum' \# [h_i] \\
\implies 0 \equiv \# H \equiv 1 + \sum' \#[h_i] \mod p
,\]
and since each $\# [h_i]$ divides $\# H$, not all can be of size $p^\ell$ since then the sum would be $0\mod p$.
So at least one other $\# [h_i] = 1$, making that $h_i$ central.

Another solution:

- Idea: use the class equation to force $p$ to divide $\#(H \intersect Z(G))$.
  Applying it to $H$ yields
\[
H = Z(H) \disjoint_{i=1}^m [h_i]
,\]
where the $[h_i]$ are conjugacy classes of size greater than 1.

- Now use that $Z(H) = Z(G) \intersect H$, and since $p$ divides the LHS the result will follow if $p$ divides the size of the disjoint union on the RHS.
- This is true because each $\#[h_i] \neq 1$ and $[h_i]$ divides $\# H$ which divides $\# G$ which is a power of $p$.
  So $p\divides \# [h_i]$ for each $i$.

- So $ax^{-n} = h_1, bx^{-m} = h_2$ where the $h_i$ are now central.

If $H\leq K \leq G$, then 
\[
\# G = [G:1] \geq [G:H] \geq [G:K] \geq [G:G] = 1
.\]
In particular, If $H, K\leq G$ are just arbitrary, since $H \intersect K \leq H, K$ we have $[H: H \intersect K] \geq [G:H] \text{ and } [G:K]$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Write $G/H \intersect K \da G/J = \ts{ h_1J, \cdots, h_m J  }$ as distinct cosets where $m\da [G:H]$ and the $h_i$ are all in $H$.
Then $i\neq j\implies h_i h_j\inv \not \in H \intersect K$, but $h_i h_j\inv \in H$ since subgroups are closed under products and inverses, which forces $h_i h_j\inv \not\in K$.
So $h_i K \neq h_j K$, meaning there are at least $m$ cosets in $G/K$, so $[G:K] \geq m$.

- The reverse containment is clear, so $G = \Union_{x\in G} xH$ is a union of its cosets.
- Suppose toward a contradiction that $\ell \in xH \intersect yH$ we'll show $xH = yH$.
- Write $\ell =xh_1 =yh_2$ for some $h_i$, then
\[
xh_1 = yh_2 &\implies x = yh_2 h_1\inv \\
xh_3\in xH &\implies xh_3 = (yh_2h_1\inv) h_3 \in yH

  so $xH \subseteq yH$.

Write $G/H = \ts{g_0 H, g_1 H, \cdots, g_N H}$ for some $N \da [G:H]$.
Since cosets are equal or disjoint and have equal cardinality, 
\[
G = \disjoint_{k \leq N} g_k H \implies \#G = \sum_{k\leq N} \# \qty{g_k H} = \sum_{k\leq N} \# H = N \# H

Counterexample: take $G = A_5$, then $\# G = 5!/2 = 60$ but $G$ has no subgroup of order $30$.
If it did, this would be index 2 and thus normal, but $A_{n\geq 5}$ is simple.

Another direct counterexample: $\abs{A_4} = 12$ but has no subgroup of order 6.
If such an $H$ existed, it can't contain every 3-cycle, since $A_4$ is generated by 3-cycles.
For $x$ any 3-cycle *not* in $H$, use that $\# A_4/H = 2$ and consider $H, xH, x^2H$.
$x\not\in H$, so $H\neq xH$, but two must be equal:

- $x^2H = H$: use $x^2 = x\inv$ since $x^3=e$, but $x\in H \implies x\inv\in H$, $\contradiction$

For any group action, the kernel is the intersection of all stabilizers:

:::{.definition title="Transitive Group Action"}
A group action $G\actson X$ is **transitive** iff for all $x, y\in X$ there exists a $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot x = x$.
Equivalently, the action has a single orbit.

:::{.proposition title="Orbit Stabilizer Isomorphism"}
If $G\actson X$ transitively, then for any choice of $x\in X$ there is an isomorphism of sets given by
\[
\Phi: G/G_{x} &\mapsvia{\sim} X \\
gG_{x} &\mapsto g\actson x

:::{.proof title="of orbit stabilizer"}

- Injectivity: $\Phi(gG_x) = \Phi(hG_x) \iff g\actson x=h\actson x \iff gh\inv \actson x = x \iff gh\inv \in G_x \iff gG_x = hG_x$.

- Well-definedness: use $gG_x = hG_x \iff gh\inv \in G_x \iff g\inv h \actson x = x$.
  Then $g (g\inv h) \actson x = g \actson x$ on one hand, and on the other $(gg\inv)h\actson x = h\actson x$, so
  \[
  \Phi(hG_x) \da h\actson x = (gg\inv) h\actson x = g(g\inv h)\actson x = g\actson x = \Phi(gG_x)

- Surjectivity: equivalent to the action being transitive.

If $X\in \GSets$, then for any points $x_i\in X$ in the same orbit, the stabilizers $G_{x_0}$ and $G_{x_1}$ are conjugate.

Note that if $G$ acts transitively, this says all stabilizers are conjugate.

- Fix $x\in X$ and $y\in \Orb(x)$, so $g.x=y$ for some $g$.
- Let $H_x \da \Stab(x)$ and $H_y\da \Stab(y)$, the claim is that $H_x = g\inv H_y g$.
- Now just check:
\[
h\in H_x &\iff hx = x \\
&\iff hg\inv y = g\inv y \\

## Examples of Orbit-Stabilizer and the Class Equation

:::{.remark title="The fixed-point count trick"}
A useful mnemonic: for any group action $\phi: G\actson X$, using that orbits partition $X$ we always have
\[
X = \Fix(\phi) \Disjoint_{x}' \Orb(x)
,\]
where $\Fix(\phi)$ is the union of all orbits of size 1, and the remaining union is over distinct nontrivial orbits, taking one representative $x$ from each.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Simple groups with a nontrivial subgroup embed into symmetric groups"}
An application of group actions:
if $G$ is simple, $H < G$ proper, and $[G:H] = n$, then there exists an injective map $\phi: G \injects S_n$.
:::

:::{.proof}
\envlist

- Define a group action $\phi: G\actson G/H \da \ts{eH, g_1 H, \cdots, g_{n-1} H}$ acting on the $n$ cosets of $H$ by left-translation $g.(g_k H) = (gg_k) H$.
- Then use that $\Sym(G/H) \leq S_n$, so $\im \phi \leq S_n$ is a subgroup.
- Since $G$ is simple and $\ker \phi \leq G$, we have $\ker \phi = 1, G$.
  If $\ker \phi = 1$, $\phi$ is injective and we're done.

- Otherwise $\ker \phi = G$, and acting on $eH$ yields $gH = H$ for all $g$, forcing $H=G$ and $n=1$, contradicting that $H<G$ is proper. $\contradiction$
:::

### Left Translation

:::{.example title="The left translation action: trivial"}
Let $G$ act on itself by left translation, where $\phi: g \mapsto (h\mapsto gh)$.

- The orbit $\Orb(x) = G$ is the entire group.
  - This action is transitive.
- The set of fixed points \( \Fix(\phi) = \ts{g\in G \st gx=x \,\forall x\in G } = \ts{ e } \) is just the identity.
- The stabilizer \( \Stab(x) = \ts{ g\in G\st gx=x } = \ts{ e } \) is just the identity.
- The kernel is the identity.
- Orbit stabilizer just says $G \cong G/\ts{e}$.

:::

### Conjugation: The Class Equation and Burnside's Lemma

:::{.example title="Conjugation yields centers/centralizers"}
Let $G$ act on *itself* by conjugation, so $\phi: g.x = gxg\inv$.

- The orbit $\Orb(g) = [g]$ is the **conjugacy class** of $g$.
  - Thus the action is transitive iff $G$ has only one single conjugacy class, which can only happen if $\# G = 1, 2$.
    On the other extreme, the orbits are all size 1 iff $G$ is abelian.
- The set of fixed points $\Fix(\phi) = Z(G)$ is the **center**.
- The stabilizer is $\Stab(g) = Z(g)$, the **centralizer** of $g$ in $G$.
- The kernel is the intersection of all centralizers, i.e. again the **center** $Z(G)$.
- Orbit-stabilizer says $[g] = G/Z(g)$, so **the size of a conjugacy class is the index of the centralizer**.

:::

:::{.remark}
Worth reiterating: $[G: Z(g)]$ is the number of elements in the conjugacy class $[g]$, and each $g \in Z(G)$ has a singleton conjugacy class $[g] = \ts{g}$.
Applying the fixed-point count trick and substituting in orbit-stabilizer yields
\[
G &= \Fix(\phi) \Disjoint_{x}' \Orb(x) \\
&= Z(G) \Disjoint_{g}' [g]\\
&= Z(G) \Disjoint_{g}' {G\over Z(g) } 
.\]

Now taking cardinalities yields the class equation:

:::

:::{.corollary title="The Class Equation"}
\[
\# {G} = \# {Z(G)} + \sum_{\substack{\text{One $g$ from} \\ \text{each nontrivial} \\ \text{conj. class}}} [G: Z(g)]
\]

As a reminder,
\[
Z(g) &= \ts{h\in G \st hgh\inv = g} \text{ is the centralizer of } g\\
Z(G) &= \ts{h\in G \st hgh\inv = g\,\, \forall g\in G} = \Intersect_{g\in G} Z(g) \text{ is the center of } G 
.\]

:::

:::{.exercise title="Applications of the class equation"}
\envlist

- Show that $p$ groups have nontrivial centers.
- Show that groups of order $p^2$ are abelian.

:::

:::{.solution}
$p\dash$groups have nontrivial centers:

- Abusing notation by identifying sets with their cardinalities, the class equation says $G = Z(G) + \sum_{g}' [G: Z(g)]$ where the terms in the sum are all bigger than 1.
- Reducing mod $p$ yields $0 = Z(g) + 0$, since $p$ must divide $[G:Z(g)]$ when $[G:Z(g)] > 1$ because $G = [G:Z(g)]Z(g)$ and $p$ divides the LHS.
- So $p$ divides $Z(g)$, making $Z(g)$ nontrivial.

$p^2$ groups are abelian:

- $Z(G) = 1,p,p^2$, and by above we know $Z(G)\neq 1$. 
  If $Z(G) = p^2$ we're done, so assume $Z(G) = p$.
- Then $G/Z(G) = p$ and groups of order $p$ are cyclic, so the $G/Z(G)$ theorem applies and $G$ is abelian.
:::

:::{.corollary title="Burnside's Lemma"}
For $G$ a finite group acting on $X$, 
\[
\# {X/G} = \frac{1}{\# G }\sum_{g\in G} \# \Fix(g)
,\]
where $X/G = \ts{\Orb(x_1), \cdots, \Orb(x_n)}$ is the set or orbits and $\Fix(g) = \ts{x\in X \st gx=x}$ are the fixed points under $g$.

> Slogan: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points.

:::

:::{.proof title="of Burnside's Lemma"}
Strategy: form the set $A \da \ts{ (g,x) \in G\cross X \st g\actson x = x }$ and write/count it in two different ways.
Write $\Stab(x) = \ts{g\in G \st gx=x}$ and $\Fix(g) = \ts{x\in X\st gx = x}$.

First union over $G$, where the inner set lets $x$ vary:
\[
A = \Disjoint_{g_0\in G} \ts{ (g_0, x) \st g_0 x = x } \cong \Disjoint_{g_0\in G} \ts{g_0}\cross \Fix(g_0) \subseteq G\cross X
.\]

Then union over $X$, where the inner set lets $g$ vary:
\[
A = \Disjoint_{x_0\in X} \ts{ (g, x_0) \st gx_0= x_0 } \cong \Disjoint_{x_0\in X} \Stab(x_0) \cross \ts{ x_0 } \subseteq G\cross X
.\]
Taking cardinalities, and using the fact that $\ts{p} \cross A \cong  A$ as sets for any set $A$,
we get the following equality
\[
\sum_{g_0\in G} \# \Fix(g_0)
= \# A
= \sum_{x_0\in X} \# \Stab(x_0)
.\]

Now rearrange orbit-stabilizer: 
\[
\Orb(x_0) = G/\Stab(x_0) \implies \# \Stab(x_0) = \# G/ \# \Orb(x_0)
,\]
and use this to rewrite the RHS:
\[
\sum_{g_0\in G} \# \Fix(g_0)
&= \sum_{x_0\in X} \# \Stab(x_0) \\
&= \sum_{x_0\in X} {\# G \over \# \Orb(x_0)} \\
&= \# G \sum_{x_0\in X} {1 \over \# \Orb(x_0)} \\ \\
\implies {1\over \# G} \sum_{g_0\in G} \# \Fix(g_0) 
&= \sum_{x_0\in X} {1\over \# \Orb(x_0)}
,\]
so it suffices to show the right-hand side sum is the number of orbits, $\#(X/G)$.

Proceed by partitioning the sum up according to which orbit each term comes from:
\[
\sum_{x_0\in X}\qty{1\over \# \Orb(x_0)} 
&= \sum_{\Orb(x_0) \in X/G} \qty{ \sum_{y\in \Orb(x_0)} \qty{1\over \# \Orb(x_0)} }\\
&= \sum_{\Orb(x_0) \in X/G} \qty{1\over \# \Orb(x_0)}\sum_{y\in \Orb(x_0)} 1  \\
&= \sum_{\Orb(x_0) \in X/G} \qty{1\over \# \Orb(x_0)} \# \Orb(x_0) \\
&= \sum_{\Orb(x_0) \in X/G} 1 \\
&= \#(X/G)
.\]

### Conjugation on Subgroups

:::{.example title="?"}
Let $G$ act on $X \da\ts{H \st H\leq G}$ (its set of *subgroups*) by conjugation.

- The orbit $\OO(H) = \theset{gHg\inv \st g\in G}$ is the **set of conjugate subgroups** of $H$.
  - This action is transitive iff all subgroups are conjugate.
- The fixed points $\Fix(G)$ form the set of **normal subgroups** of $G$.

- The stabilizer $\Stab(H) = N_G(H)$ is the **normalizer** of $H$ in $G$.

- The kernel is the intersection of all normalizers: $\ker \phi = \Intersect_{H\leq G} N_G(H)$.

- Applying Orbit-stabilizer yields that the number of conjugates is the index of the normalizer:
\[
\# {\ts{ gHg ^{-1} \st g \in G } } = [G: N_G(H)]
.\]

:::

### Left Translation on Cosets

:::{.example title="?"}
For a fixed proper subgroup $H< G$, let $G$ act on its cosets $X \da G/H \da \theset{gH\suchthat g\in G}$ by left translation.

- The orbit $\OO(xH) = G/H$, the entire set of cosets.

  - Note that this is a *transitive* action, since the trivial coset $eH\in G/H$ and its orbit is $gH$ as $g$ ranges over $G$, hitting every coset representative.

- The stabilizer $\Stab(xH) = xHx\inv$, a **conjugate subgroup** of $H$.
  - This is because
  \[
  \Stab(xH) &= \ts{g\in G\st gxH = xH} \\
  &= \ts{g\in G \st x\inv g x\in H} \\
  &= \ts{g\in G\st gx\in xH}\\
  &= \ts{g\in G\st g\in xHx\inv} \\
  &= xHx\inv
  .\]

- There are no fixed points, i.e. $\Fix(G) = \emptyset$, since the action is transitive.

- The kernel of this action is $\ker \phi = \Intersect_{g\in G} gHg\inv$, the intersection of all conjugates of $H$, sometimes called the **normal core** of $H$.

  - Note that if $\ker \phi = G$ then $H$ is normal, and if $\ker \phi = 1$ then at least one conjugate doesn't intersect $H$ nontrivially.

:::

:::{.proposition title="Application of translation action on cosets"}
If $G$ is a finite group and $p\da [G:H]$ is the smallest prime dividing $\# G$, then $H\normal G$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
\envlist

- Let $\phi: G\actson X\da \ts{xH}$, noting that $\# X = p$ and $\Sym(X) \cong S_p$.
- Then $K\da \ker \phi$, and importantly $K \contains H$ since $K$ is the intersection of stabilizers, and contains $\Stab(eH) \contains H$ since $gH = H \implies g\in H$.
- Since $G$ is finite and $K\leq G$, we have $\#(G/K)$ dividing $\# G$, since
  \[
  [G:K] = \# (G/K) = \# G/ \# K \implies \# G = \#(G/K) \# K
  .\]
- Now
\[
G/K \cong K' \leq S_p \implies \#(G/K)\divides p!
.\]

- So $\# (G/K)$ divides $\gcd( \# G, p!)=p$, using that $p$ was the minimal prime dividing $\# G$.
  This forces $\#(G/K)$ to be 1 or $p$.
- If it's $p$:
  - Then $p = [G:K] = [G:H]$ and since $K\contains H$ this forces $K=H$.
  Kernels are automatically normal, so we're done.
- If it's 1:
  - Then $[G:K] = 1$ and $K = \ker \phi = G$.
  - Identifying $\ker \phi = \Intersect_{xH\in G/H} \Stab(xH)$, we have $\Stab(xH) = xHx\inv = G$ for all $x$, which says $H$ is normal.

# Sylow Theorems

:::{.remark}
Useful facts:

- Counting contributions to $\# G$ from $\Syl_p(G)$: writing $\# G = p^k m$ so that $\# S_p = p^k$, using that every order $p$ element is in some $S_p$ one gets at least $n_p(\ell - 1)$ for some constant $\ell > 1$.
  - **Warning**: every $S_p$ is the same size, so it's tempting to take $\ell \da \# S_p = p^k$.
    But this only works if one knows the $S_p$ intersect trivially, e.g. if $k=1$.
    Otherwise, the best one can do without more information $\ell = p$, i.e. the $S_p$ all intersect trivially or in subgroups of order $p$.
  - **Warning**:
  This isn't quite a count of elements of order $p$, since elements in $S_p$ can have orders $p^{k'}$ for other $k'\leq k$.
- When counting: just leave the identity out of every calculation, and add it back in as a $+1$ for the final count.
:::

:::{.definition}
A **$p\dash$group** is a group $G$ such that every element is order $p^k$ for some $k$.
  If $G$ is a finite $p\dash$group, then $\abs G = p^j$ for some $j$.
:::

:::{.lemma title="Congruences for fixed points"}
If $G\actson X$ for $G$ a $p\dash$group, then letting $\Fix(G) \da \ts{x\in X \st gx=x}$, one has
\[
\# X \equiv \# \Fix(G) \mod p
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
\envlist

- Use the fixed-point count trick:
\[
\# X = \# \Fix(G) + \sum_{x}' \# \Orb(x)
.\]
  Note that the result follows immediately by reducing $\mod p$ if the sum is zero $\mod p$. 
- Letting $x$ be an element with a nontrivial orbit, we have $\# \Orb(x) > 1$, so $\Stab(x) \neq G$ since orbit-stabilizer would yield $\# \Orb(x) = [G:\Stab(x)] = 1$.
- Now use that $\# \Orb(x) = \# G/ \#\Stab(x) = p^k/p^\ell$ where $0< \ell < k$ with strict inequalities.
  So $\# \Orb(x) = p^{k-\ell} \neq 1$, and $p$ divides its size.

:::{.theorem title="Sylow 1"}
\[
\forall p^n \text{ dividing } \abs{G} \text{, there exists a subgroup of size } p^n
.\]
:::

:::{.slogan}
Sylow $p\dash$subgroups exist for any $p$ dividing $\abs{G}$, and are maximal in the sense that every $p\dash$subgroup of $G$ is contained in a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.
If $\abs G = \prod p_i^{\alpha_i}$, then there exist subgroups of order $p_i^{\beta_i}$ for every $i$ and every $0 \leq \beta_i \leq \alpha_i$.
In particular, Sylow $p\dash$subgroups always exist.
:::

:::{.proof title="of Sylow 1: left translation"}
\envlist

- Let $\# G = p^k m$.
  Idea: Induct up by showing that if $\# H = p^i$ for $i\leq k$, one can product a bigger subgroup $\tilde H \contains H$ with $[\tilde H : H] = p$.
  This makes $\# \tilde H = p^{i+1}$.
- Let $H\leq G$ so that $H$ is a $p\dash$group.
- Let $H\actson G/H$ by left-translation.
- Use the lemma that $\#(G/H)\equiv \Fix_H(G/H)\mod p$
- Identify $\Fix_H(G/H) = N_G(H)$, since fixing $xH$ means $gxH = xH \implies gHg\inv \subseteq H \implies gHg\inv = H$ for all $g\in G$.
\[
xH \in \Fix_H(G/H) 
&\iff gxH &= xH \forall g\in H\\
&\iff x\inv g x H \in H \forall g\in H\\
&\iff x\inv H x\inv = H \\
&\iff x\in N_G(H)
,\]
  so $\Fix_H(G/H) = \ts{gH \st g\in N(H)} = N_G(H)/ H$ are cosets whose representatives are normalizers of $H$.
- Since $H\normal N_G(H)$, these cosets form a group.
- We have $[G:H] = \#(N_G(H) / H)$, and if $i<k$ then $p$ divides $[G: H]$.
- So $N_G(H)/H$ is a $p\dash$group and has a subgroup $L$ of order $p$ by Cauchy.
- Use the subgroup correspondence: $L\leq N_G(H)/H$ corresponds to some $L' \leq G$ with $H \subseteq L' \subseteq N_G(H)$ and $L = L'/H$.
  Now use that $\# L = p$ implies $\#(L' / H) = [L':H] = p$, so $\# L' = [L':H]\#H = p\#H = p^{i+1}$ as desired.

\[
\# (G/S_2) \equiv \Fix_{S_1}(G/S_2) \mod p
.\]

- $[G:S_2] = m$ is coprime to $p$, so there is a fixed point, say $xS_2$ where $gxS_2 = xS_2$ for all $g\in S_1$.
\[
gxS_2 = xS_2 \forall g\in S_1 \\
\implies gx \in xS_2 \forall g\in S_1 \\
\implies S_1 x \subseteq xS_2 \\
\implies S_1 \subseteq xS_2 x\inv

2. $n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$.

3. $n_p = [G : N_G(S_p)]$ where $N_G$ is the normalizer.

:::


:::{.proof title="of Sylow 3"}
\envlist

- $n_p\equiv 1 \mod p$:
  - Fix a $P\in \Syl_p(G)$, and let $P\actson \mcs \da \Syl_p(G)$ by conjugation.
  - Apply the lemma to get $n_p \equiv \Fix_{\mcs}(P) \mod p$.
    The claim is that there is just one fixed point.
  - If $Q\in \Fix_{\mcs}(P)$, then $pQp\inv = Q$ for all $p\in P$, so $P$ normalizes $Q$ and $P \subseteq N_G(Q) \leq G$.
  - Then $P, Q \in \Syl_p(N_G(Q))$, which by Sylow II are conjugate.
  - Since $Q\normal N_G(Q)$, there is only one conjugate of $Q$, and $P=Q$.
  - So $P$ is the only fixed point.

- $n_p \divides m$:
  - Let $G\actson X\da \Syl_p(G)$ by conjugation; this is transitive by Sylow II and there is one orbit.
  - Then $\# X$ must divide $\# G$, so $n_p$ divides $\# G = p^k m$.
  - Using $n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$, we can't have $n_p\divides p^k$, and so $n^p$ must divide $m$.

- $n_p = [G: N_G(P)]$ for any $P\in \Syl_p(G)$:
  - Let $G\actson \Syl_p(G)$ by conjugation and apply orbit-stabilizer to get $n_p = [G: \Stab(P)]$
  - Identify $\Stab(P) = N_G(P)$.

Every $p\dash$subgroup of $G$ is contained in a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.
:::

Let $H \leq G$ be a $p\dash$subgroup.
If $H$ is not *properly* contained in any other $p\dash$subgroup, it is a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup by definition.
Otherwise, it is contained in some $p\dash$subgroup $H^1$.
Inductively this yields a chain $H \subsetneq H^1 \subsetneq \cdots$, and by Zorn's lemma $H\definedas \union_i H^i$ is maximal and thus a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.

## Automorphism Groups

Some facts about common automorphism groups, and how to count and reason about them.
There's a good reference here: <https://www.whitman.edu/documents/Academics/Mathematics/SeniorProject_BrianSloan.pdf>


Let $\varphi$ be the totient function, and note that a cyclic group $C_n$ has precisely $\phi(n)$ choices of generators.
One can compute
\[
\phi(p) &= p-1 \\
\phi(p^k) &= p^{k-1}(p - 1) \\
\phi(p^kq^\ell) &= \phi(p^k)\phi(q^\ell) \quad\text{when } \gcd(q, p) = 1
.\]

- Automorphisms of cyclic groups are completely known:
\[
\Aut(C_n) \cong C_n\units 
,\]
which has size $\phi(n)$ but is not generally isomorphic to $C_{\phi(n)}$

For example, $C_8\units \cong C_2^2 \neq C_{4}$.
In fact, $C_n\units$ cyclic iff $n=2,4,p^k, 2p^k$ for $p$ an odd prime.
:::


- For $p$ an odd prime, $\Aut(C_p) \cong C_p\units \cong C_{p-1}$ is cyclic. 

- For $p^k$ an odd prime power, $\Aut(C_{p^k}) \cong C_{\varphi(p^k)}$ is cyclic.

- For $2^k$ with $k\geq 1$, $C_{2^k}\units \cong C_{2}\times C_{2^{k-2}}$.

- If $G, H$ have coprime order then $\Aut(G \cross H) \cong \Aut(G) \cross  \Aut(H)$.
  One can then compute a general order by factoring $n = \prod_{k=1}^\ell p_k^{n_k}$ to get a decomposition 
\[
C_n= C_{\prod_{k=1}^\ell p_k^{n_k}}= \prod_{k=1}^{\ell} C_{p_k^{n_k}} 
,\]
  and thus
  \[
  \Aut(C_n) 
  &\cong \Aut\qty{\prod_{k=1}^{\ell} C_{p_k^{n_k}} }\\
  &\cong \prod_{k=1}^\ell \Aut\qty{C_{p_k^{n_k}}} \\
  &\cong \prod_{k=1}^\ell C_{p_k^{n_k}}\units \\
  &\cong C_{2^{\ell}}\units \cross \prod_{\substack{k=1 \\ p_k\neq 2} }^\ell C_{p_k^{n_k}}\units \\
  &\cong \qty{C_2 \cross C_{2^{\ell-2}} } \cross \prod_{\substack{k=1 \\ p_k\neq 2} }^\ell C_{m_k} && m_k \da \varphi(p_k^{n_k}) \\
  &\cong \qty{C_2 \cross C_{2^{\ell-2}} } \cross \prod_{\substack{k=1 \\ p_k\neq 2} }^\ell C_{m_k} &&  m_k \da p_k^{n_k-1}(p_k-1)  
  .\]



- $\Aut(C_p^n) \cong \GL_n(\FF_p)$ which has size 
\[
\# \GL_n(\FF_p) = \prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(p^n-p^k) = (p^n-1)(p^n-p)(p^n-p^2)\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1})
.\]


- Counting homs: $\# \Hom_\Grp(C_n, C_m) = \gcd(n ,m)$.


-  If $\sigma \in \Aut(H)$ and $\tau \in \Aut(N)$, then \(N \semidirect_\psi H \cong N \semidirect_{\tau \circ \psi \circ \sigma} H\).
  - So if $\GL_n$ shows up in a semidirect product, it suffices to consider similarity classes of matrices (i.e. just use canonical forms).

- $\Inn(G) \cong G/Z(G)$.

3. Every *normal* subgroup of $G/N$ is of the form $K/N$ for some such $K \normal G$.

Things are particularly nice when the orders of $H$ and $k$ are coprime.

Thus for 2, one only needs that $\#(HK) = \# G$.

:::{.proof title="?"}
With these conditions, the following map is an isomorphism:
\[
\Gamma: H\cross K &\to G \\
(h, k) &\mapsto hk

- This is a group morphism by condition (1):

&= h_1 ( { \color{red} h_2 k_1 } ) k_2 \\
&= (h_1 h_2) ( k_1 k_2) \\
&\da \Gamma( (h_1, k_1)(h_2, k_2) )
.\]
- This is surjective by condition (2)
- This is injective by condition(3) and checking the kernel:
\[
\ker \Gamma = \ts{ (h,k) \st hk = 1_G,\, hk = 1_G} \implies h = k ^{-1} \implies hk \in K \intersect H = \ts{1_G}

## Classification: Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

G \cong \ZZ^r \cross \prod_{k=1}^m C_{p^k}^{e_k} 
,\]
where $r\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$ is uniquely determined.

:::

:::{.proposition title="Converting between elementary divisors and invariant factors"}
Given any presentation of a group as a product of cyclic groups $G = \prod \ZZ_i/m_i$, with the $m_i$ not necessarily distinct, 

- Factor all of the $m_i$ into prime powers, keeping the exponents intact.
- Organize into a table whose columns correspond to individual primes $p_i$.
  - Within an individual column for the prime $p_k$, write all terms of the form $p_k^{e_k}$ (with exponents intact) 
  - Arrange the terms from lowest at the top to highest at the bottom.
    Push everything down so that the bottom-most rows are all filled out. 
- For **elementary divisors**, just list out all of elements of the table individually, running across rows.
- For **invariant factors**, iterate a process of taking the largest of each prime power (i.e. the bottom row) at each step, deleting that row, and continuing in the same fashion.

> Note: this sounds much more complicated than it actually is. Try it!

:::

:::{.example title="Abstract Example"}
\envlist

Suppose $G$ is given to you as a product of cyclic groups whose sizes factor in the following way
\[
p_1^{e_1}p_1^{e_2}p_1^{e_3} \cdot p_2^{f_1}p_2^{f_2} \cdot p_3^{g_1} p_3^{g_2} p_3^{g_3} \cdot p_4^{h_1}
.\]

Assemble these into a table, grouped by prime factor $p_i$, being careful not to separate primes from their exponents:

| $p_1$       | $p_2$       | $p_3$       | $p_4$       |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| $p_1^{e_1}$ |             | $p_3^{g_1}$ |             |
| $p_1^{e_2}$ | $p_2^{f_1}$ | $p_3^{g_2}$ |             |
| $p_1^{e_3}$ | $p_2^{f_2}$ | $p_3^{g_3}$ | $p_4^{h_1}$ |


For elementary divisors: take columns, which just amounts to listing them again:
\[
&\quad \ZZ/p_1^{e_1} \cross \ZZ/p_1^{e_2} \cross \ZZ/p_1^{e_3} \\
&\quad \cross \ZZ/p_2^{f_1} \cross \ZZ/p_2^{f_2} \\
&\quad \cross \ZZ/p_3^{g_1} \cross \ZZ/p_3^{g_2} \cross \ZZ/p_3^{g_3} \\
&\quad \cross \ZZ/p_4^{h_1} 
.\]

For invariant factors: take rows (grouped by CRT)
\[
& \quad \ZZ / \qty{p_1^{e_3} p_2^{f_2} p_3^{g_3} p_4^{h_1}} \\
&\quad \cross \ZZ/ \qty{p_1^{e_2} p_2^{f_1} p_3^{g_2}} \\
&\quad \cross \ZZ/\qty{p_1^{e_1} p_3^{g_1} }
.\]

:::

:::{.example title="of putting a group in invariant factor form"}
\[
G = {\ZZ_{2}\times\ZZ_{2}\times\ZZ_{2}\times\ZZ_{3}\times\ZZ_{3}\times\ZZ_{5^2}}
\]

I'll use a shortcut for the table: instead of listing columns, I just list the prime powers for a single $p$ in increasing order in the same cell. 
Then just always take the largest prime power in each cell at each stage:

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2,2,2$ |  $3,3$ | $5^2$

$\implies n_m = 5^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2,2$ |  $3$ | $\emptyset$

$\implies n_{m-1} = 3 \cdot 2$

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2$ |  $\emptyset$ | $\emptyset$

$\implies n_{m-2} = 2$

and thus the invariant factor form is
\[
G\cong \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{3\cdot 2} \times \ZZ_{5^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}
\]
:::

:::{.example}
\[
G \da \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{2^3} \times \ZZ_{5^2\cdot 7} 
\]
Make the table by factoring the order of each cyclic piece, being careful not to combine terms that come from distinct summands (e.g. not combining the two copies of $2^1$), and to keep exponents from factorizations intact as a single term (e.g. the $2^3$):

| $2$   | $5$   | $7$ |
|-------|-------|-----|
| $2$   |       |     |
| $2$   |       |     |
| $2^3$ | $5^2$ | $7$ |

Reading across rows from bottom to top (and using CRT to merge everything within a row) yields invariant factors on the LHS below.
Reading down columns, left to right (merging nothing) yields elementary divisors on the right-hand side below

\[
\ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7}
\cong
\ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{2^3} \times \ZZ_{5^2} \times \ZZ_7
.\]

:::{.proposition title="Number of abelian groups is given by products of partition numbers"}
If $\# G \da n = \prod_{k=1}^m p_k^{e_k}$, then there are exactly $\prod_{k=1}^m P(e_k)$ abelian groups of order $n$, where $P$ is the integer partition function.
:::

:::{.example title="of an integer partition"}
One can compute $P(6) = 11$, where all of the partitions are given by
\[
&[6], \\

&[2, 1, 1, 1, 1], \\
&[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
.\]

:::

:::{.remark}
In practice, it is easy to list all of the partitions out for a given $n$, but it's also useful to have a systematic way to generate them and actually check that you have them all.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Formula for partitions"}
There is a recurrence relation
\[
P_k(n) = P_k(n-k) + P_{k-1}(n-1)
,\]
which follows from the fact that one can obtain a partition of $n$ with $k$ parts by either

- Taking a partition of $n-k$ into $k$ parts and adding 1 to each part, e.g. $[1,1,1,3] \mapsto [2,2,2,4]$
- Taking a partition of $n-1$ into $k-1$ parts and adding a new standalone part $1$, e.g. $[1,1,2,5] \mapsto [1,1,2,5,1]$.

Summing over $k$ yields the following, which can be recursed:
\[
P(n) 
&= \sum_{k=1}^n P_k(n-k) + P(n-1) \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^n P_k(n-k) + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} P_k(n-1-k) + P(n-2) \\
&= \cdots
,\]
where $P_k(m) = 0$ for $k>m$ and $P_m(m) = 1$.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
One can compute that $P(5) = 7$, and the formula recovers this:
\[
P(5) 
&= \sum_{k=1}^5 P_{k}(5-k) + P(4) \\
&= \qty{ P_1(4) + P_2(3) } + P(4) \\
&= \qty{ P_1(4) + P_2(3) } + \qty{P_1(3) + P_2(2)} + P(3) \\
&= \qty{ P_1(4) + P_2(3) } + \qty{P_1(3) + P_2(2)} + \qty{P_1(2)} + P(2) \\
&= \qty{ P_1(4) + P_2(3) } + \qty{P_1(3) + P_2(2)} + \qty{P_1(2)} + \qty{P_1(1) + P(1)} \\
&= \qty{1 + 1 } + \qty{1 + 1} + \qty{1} + \qty{1 + 1} \\
&= 7
.\]
Note that you could just stop at the third line, since $P(3) = 3$ is easy to enumerate: $[1,1,1], [1,2], [3]$.
:::

:::{.example title="Applying this to classifying groups"}
Suppose $\# G = n = p^3 q^4$. 
Compute that $p(3) = 3$ and $p(4) = 5$, so there should be 15 abelian groups of this order.
Enumerate the partitions:

- For 3: $[1,1,1], [1,2], [3]$
- For 4: $[1,1,1,1], [1,2,1], [1,3], [2,2], [4]$

Now for every distinct pair taking one from the first line and one from the second, we get a group of that order.
A partition of $m$ of the form $[a,b,c, \cdots]$ contributes a group of the form $\ZZ_{m^a} \cross \ZZ_{m^b} \cross \ZZ_{m^c} \cdots$.

2. If $q\divides p-1$ then $G\cong S_q \semidirect_\psi S_p$ where $S_p \normal G$ and $\psi: S_q \to \Aut(S_p)$, and $G$ has a presentation

:::

:::{.proof title="of $pq$ theorem, case 1"}
\envlist

- Suppose $q<p$.
- Apply the Sylow theorems to $p$:
  - $n_p \cong 1 \mod p \implies n_p \in \ts{ 1, p+1, 2p+1, \cdots }$.
  - $n_p \divides q \implies n_p \in \ts{ 1, q }$.
  - Since $1<q<p<p+1$, this forces $n_p = 1$
- Suppose $q\notdivides p-1$ and apply the Sylow theorems to $q$:
  - $n_q \equiv 1\mod q \implies n_q \in \ts{ 1, q+1, 2q+1,\cdots }$
  - $n_q \divides p \implies n_q\in \ts{ 1, p }$
  - Now note that if $n_q\neq 1$, then $n_q=p$ and $p$ is of the form $kq+1$ for some $k$.
  - **Use of assumption**: then $p=kq+1 \iff p-1 = kq \iff q\divides p-1$, which is precisely what we assumed is *not* the case.
- So $n_p = n_q = 1$ and $S_p, S_q \normal G$.
- Apply recognition of direct products:
  - $S_p, S_q \leq G$: check.
  - $S_p, S_q \normal G$: check.
  - $S_p \intersect S_q = \ts{ e }$: check, because they are coprime order.
  - $S_p S_q = G$: follows from a counting argument:
  \[
  \# S_pS_q = {\# S_p \# S_q \over \# \qty{S_p \intersect S_q}} = {pq \over 1} = \# G
  .\]
  If $G$ is finite, then $AB\leq G$ with $\#AB = \#G$ implies $AB = G$.
:::

:::{.proof title="of $pq$ theorem, case 2"}

- Suppose $q \divides p-1$, the previous argument for $S_p$ works, but the argument for $S_q$ doesn't, so we get a semidirect product.
- Work up to isomorphism:
\[
S_p \cong \ZZ/p = \gens{a\st a^p}
&\normal G \\ \\
S_q \cong \ZZ/q =\gens{b\st b^q}
&\leq G
.\]
- We have 
\[
G&\cong \ZZ/q \semidirect_{\psi} \ZZ/p
&& \psi: \ZZ/q \to \Aut\qty{\ZZ/p} \\ \\
\implies G &\cong\gens{a,b \st a^p, b^q,\,\, aba\inv = \psi(b) = b^\ell } && \text{for some }\ell
.\]
  - Since $\ZZ/q$ is cyclic, such a morphism is determined by the image of the generator $[1]_q \in \ZZ/q$.
  - Note that $[1]_q \mapsto \id_{\ZZ/p}$ is such a morphism, and yields the direct product again.
- Identify $\Aut(\ZZ/p) \cong \qty{\qty{\ZZ/p}\units, \times } \cong \qty{ \ZZ/(p-1), +}$.
- So we need to classify morphisms
\[
\psi: \ZZ/q\to \ZZ/(p-1)
.\]
  - Consider $\im\psi \leq \ZZ/(p-1)$.
  - Sending $[1]_q$ to the identity in $\Aut(\ZZ/p)$ yields the direct product again, so pick nontrivial morphisms.
  - Since $\# \im \psi \divides q$ which is prime, its order is equal to $q$.
  - Since $q\divides p-1$ and $\ZZ/(p-1)$ is cyclic of order $p-1$, by Cauchy's theorem there is a unique subgroup of order $q$, say $C_q \leq \ZZ(p-1)$
  - We can send $[1]_q$ to $[\alpha]_{p-1} \in \ZZ/(p-1)$ where $\alpha$ is any generator of $C_q$, of which there are $\phi(q) = q-1$ nontrivial choices.

- Thus there are $q-1$ distinct nontrivial choices for the action $\psi: \ZZ/q \to \ZZ/(p-1)$.

:::{.claim}
All choices yield isomorphic semidirect products.
:::

- Use that $G\da A\semidirect_{\psi} N$ with $\psi:A\to \Aut(N)$ is an $\Aut(N)$ and $\Aut(A)$ module, where $f \in \Aut(N)$ and $\pi\in \Aut(A)$ act in the following ways:
\[
\pi &\actson A\semidirect_\psi N = A \semidirect_{\psi \circ \pi } N \\
f &\actson A\semidirect_\psi N = A \semidirect_{\gamma_f \circ \psi } N
.\]
where
\[
\gamma_f: \Aut(N) &\to \Aut(N) \\
\psi &\mapsto f\circ \psi \circ f\inv
.\]
  - These actions preserve the group isomorphism type of $G$

- However, since $C_q \leq \ZZ/(p-1)$ and $\Aut(C_q) \cong \ZZ/(q-1)$, there are exactly $q-1$ automorphisms of the image $C_q$, say $\ts{\pi_k}_{k=1}^{q-1}$.
- So $\psi \circ \pi_k: \ZZ/q \to \ZZ/(p-1)$ for $1\leq k \leq q-1$ yields $q-1$ distinct actions, and we're done.

If $N\normal G$ and $P\in \Syl_p(H)$ then $G = N_G(P)H$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}

- Let $g\in G$, then since $P\leq H \normal G$ we have $gPg\inv \subseteq gHg\inv = H$.
- So $P' \da gPg\inv \in \Syl_p(H)$ for all $g$, and since Sylows in $H$ are all conjugate, we can write $P' = h\inv Ph\inv$ for some $h\in H$.
- This says $hPh\inv = gPg\inv$ and thus $P = (g\inv h)P (h\inv g) = (h\inv g)\inv P (h\inv g)$.

Every finite $p$ group is solvable.
:::

- By induction on $k$ in $\# G = p^k$: if $\# G = p$ then $G$ is abelian and automatically solvable. 
- Inductively, for $\# G = p^k$, now consider $Z(G)\neq 1$ since we're in a $p\dash$group.
- If $G/Z(G)$ is abelian, use the general fact: $H$ solvable and $G/H$ solvable implies $G$ solvable.
  - Here $Z(G)$ and $G/Z(G)$ are both abelian and thus solvable.
- Otherwise $G/Z(G)$ is a $p\dash$group of size $p^{k-1}$ and thus solvable by hypothesis.

:::{.lemma title="$pq$ groups have normals the size of the biggest prime"}
If $\# G = pq$ with $p<q$ distinct primes, then $G$ has a normal subgroup of size $q$.

This is immediate from Sylow theory: $[n_q]_q = 1, n_q \divides p, p<q$ forces $n_q = 1$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="PQR Theorem"}
If $|G| = pqr$ where $p<q<r$ are distinct primes then $G$ is solvable.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
\envlist

Idea: 

- Get a normal subgroup $R$ of order $r$, so $\# (G/R) = pq$.
- Get a normal subgroup $Q_1$ of order $q$ in $G/R$, which corresponds to $Q\normal G$ of order $qr$ containing $R$.
  Note that $R\normal Q$ since normality descends to subgroups.
- Now $G\to Q\to R \to 1$ is a subnormal series whose quotients are all cyclic and thus abelian:
  - $\#(G/Q) = pqr/qr = p$,
  - $\#(Q/R) = qr/r = q$,
  - $\#(R/1) = r$,

:::

:::{.remark}
Proof of first claim: let $m\da \# G = pqr$, then $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $r$.

- Claim: at least one of the Sylows for $p,q,$ or $r$ is normal.
  - If none of the Sylow $p,q,r$ groups are normal, then $n_r \geq r$ and $n_p \geq q$.
    Counting the contributions from just $\Syl_q(G)$ and $\Syl_p(G)$ yields
  \[
  n_q(q-1) + n_r(r-1) \geq pr(q-1) + pq(r-1) = pqr + p(qr -q - r)
  .\]

  - If this is to be at most $m$, it must be that $qr-q-r$ is negative (since $p>1$ and otherwise this would yield more than $pqr$ elements).
  - But if this holds,
  \[
  qr-q-r \leq 0 \iff q(r-1) \leq r \iff q\leq {r\over r-1}
  .\]
    But $q>2$ be assumption, and $1\leq {r\over r-1}\leq 2$ for any number $r$. $\contradiction$.

  - So there is one of $S_p , S_q, S_r$ that is normal in $G$.

- Now if $S_r$ is normal we're done, so suppose not and $n_r > 1$.
  Claim: we can get another subgroup of order $r$ 

  - Let $N$ be the normal Sylow, so either $N\in \Syl_p(G)$ or $N\in \Syl_q(G)$.
  - Then $G/N$ has order $r\ell$ for either $\ell = q$ or $\ell = p$ respectively.
    
  - In either case, $\ell < r$.
    Using the lemma, $G/N$ has a normal subgroup of size $r$, say $R/N \leq G/N$.
  - Then by the subgroup correspondence theorem, $R$ corresponds to a normal subgroup $R'\normal G$ of size $r\ell$ with $r<\ell$.
  - Applying the same lemma to $R'$ immediately yields a normal subgroup $R''$ of order $r$ in $R'$
  - Now use that $R'' \operatorname{char} R'$ since Sylows are characteristic, and $R'\normal G$, so $R''\normal G$ too.

A **composition series** of a group $G$ is a finite normal series such that $G^{i+1}$ is a *maximal proper* normal subgroup of $G^i$.

Then $Z_0 \leq Z_1 \leq \cdots$ is the *upper central series* of $G$.

## Solvability


:::{.remark}
A useful way to extract normal subgroups: let $G$ act on literally anything by $\phi: G\to \Aut(X)$.
Then $\ker \phi \normal G$ is always a normal subgroup.
Some examples:

- $G\actson G$ by $x\mapsto gx$.
- $G\actson \ts{H\leq G}$ by $H\mapsto gH$ or $H\mapsto gHg\inv$.

## Isomorphism Theorems

:::

:::{.proposition title="First Isomorphism Theorem"}
For any ring morphism $f:A\to B$ there is SES of rings
\[
0 \to \ker f \to A \to \im(f) \to 0
,\]
and thus $A/\ker f \cong \im f$.
If $f$ is surjective, then $A/\ker f \cong B$.

More traditionally stated:

- $\ker \phi \in \Id(A)$
- $\im \phi \leq B$ is a subring (not necessarily an ideal)
- $R/\ker \phi \cong \im \phi$.
:::


:::{.proposition title="Second Isomorphism Theorem"}
Let $R\in \Ring, S\leq R, I\in \Id(R)$, then there is an isomorphism:
\[
{S+I \over I} \mveq {S\over S \intersect I}
.\]

Where it's also true that this statement makes sense:

- $S+I \leq R$ is a subring.
- $S \intersect I \normal S$
:::


:::{.proposition title="Third Isomorphism Theorem"}
For $I\in \Id(R)$, the canonical quotient map $\phi: R \to R/I$ induces a bijective correspondence:
\[
\correspond{
  J \in \Id(R) \st J\contains I
}
&\mapstofrom
  \Id(R/I) \\
J \da \phi\inv(\bar J) &\mapsfrom \bar{J} \\
J &\mapsto \bar{J} \da \phi(J) 
,\]
where $\phi: R\to R/I$ is the canonical quotient morphism.

More traditionally:

- If $S, I \in \Id(R)$ with $S$ containing $I$ then
\[
S/I \leq R/I
.\]

- Every ideal in $\Id(R/I)$ is of the form $\bar{S} \da S/I$ for some $S\in \Id(R)$ containing $I$.

- If $I, J \in \Id(R)$ with $I \subseteq J \subseteq R$ then there is an isomorphism
\[
{R/I \over J/I} \mveq {R\over J}
.\]

Moreover, $A\leq R$ is a subring containing $I$ iff $A/I \in \Id(R/I)$.

$R \in \Field \iff \Id(R) = \ts{ 0, R }$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
$\implies$:
If $0\neq x\in I\normal R$, using that $R\nonzero = R\units$, $x$ is a unit.
So $x\inv \in R$, and $xx\inv \da 1 \in I$ so $I = R$.

$\impliedby$:
Let $x\in R\nonzero$, then $Rx = R$ so $1\in Rx$ and $1=rx$ for some $r\in R$.
This forces $x=r\inv$.

- $R/\mfm$ is a field $\iff \mfm \in \mspec(R)$ is maximal.
- $R/\mfp$ is an integral domain $\iff \mfp \in \spec(R)$ is prime.
- $R/J$ is reduced $\iff J$ is radical.
:::


:::{.proof title="of 1"}
Use the ideal correspondence theorem: $\Id(R/\mfm)$ are ideals of $R$ containing $\mfm$:
\[
&\quad R/\mfm \in \Field \\
&\iff \not\exists J/\mfm \in \Id(R/\mfm)\nonzero \text{ such that } J \in \Id(R) \\
&\iff \not\exists \mfm \subsetneq J \subsetneq R \\
&\iff J\in \mspec(R)
.\]

:::


:::{.proof title="of 2"}
$\impliedby$:
Show $xy = 0$ with $x\neq 0$ forces $y=0$.
Let $x, y\in \mfp \in \spec R$, so $x = a + I, y = b + I$ for some $a,b\in R$.
If $xy=0 \mod \mfp$ with $y\neq 0\mod \mfp$, we can check
\[
xy = (a+\mfp)(b+\mfp) \da (ab) + \mfp = 0 + \mfp \implies ab\in \mfp
.\]
Since $\mfp$ is prime and $x\neq 0 \implies a\not\in\mfp$, so $b\in \mfp$.
But then 
\[
y \da b + \mfp = 0 + \mfp = 0 \mod \mfp
.\]

$\implies$:
Let $a,b\in R$ with $xy\in \mfp$, we want to show that if $x\not \in \mfp$ then $y\in \mfp$.
Note $x\not \in \mfp \iff x \cong 0 \mod \mfp$.
Setting $x\da a + \mfp, y\da b + \mfp$ yields
\[
xy \da (a+\mfp)(b+\mfp) \da ab + \mfp = 0 \mod \mfp
.\]
Since $R/\mfp$ is a domain, assuming $x\neq 0 \mod \mfp$ we have $y = 0 \mod \mfp$, so $y\in \mfp$.




:::

Note that this yields a quick proof that $\mspec R \subseteq \spec R$, using that $\Field \leq \mathsf{IntDomain}$:

- Distributivity: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$.
:::

:::{.example title="of rings"}
Some of the most important examples of rings:

  - Their analogs: number fields $K \da \QQ(\zeta)$, their rings of integers $\ZZ_K$ or $\OO_K$,
- Gaussian integers $\ZZ(i)$
- Fields $k = \FFpn, \RR$
- Fraction fields of rings $\ff(R)$, e.g. $\ff(\ZZ) = \QQ$.
- Polynomial rings $R\adjoin{\elts{x}{n}}$, particularly for $R=k$ a field
- Power series rings $R\powerseries{\elts{x}{n}}$.
  - Formal power series rings $R\formalpowerseries{\elts{x}{n}}$.
- $\ZZpadic \da \ts{a/b \st p \notdivides b }$ the ring of $p\dash$adic integers
- Rings of germs, e.g. $C^\infty(X, Y)$ where $f\sim g$ iff there exists some $U \subseteq X$ with $\ro{f}{U} = \ro{g}{U}$.

A morphism $f\in \CRing(X, Y)$ satisfies:

Important notes:

- $\ker f \da f\inv(\ts{0})$.
- A bijective ring morphisms is automatically an isomorphism in $\CRing$.
- $\ker f \normal X$ is an ideal, but $\im f \leq Y$ is only a subring in general.
- For any ideal $I\normal R$ there is a quotient map $R\to R/I$, it's useful to write cosets as $a+I$.

Equivalently,

- $RI \subseteq I$
- $I + I \subseteq I$

Note that $0$ is in every ideal.

:::





:::{.example title="Some counterexamples"}
Some examples.
Reminder: maximal always implies prime, and for PIDs, prime *and nonzero* implies maximal.
Maximals quotient to fields, primes to domains.

- Prime and maximal: 
  - $p\ZZ \in \Id(\ZZ)$.
    Maximal (and thus prime) since $\ZZ/p$ is a field and a domain.
  - $\gens{2, x} \in \Id(\ZZ[x])$.
    Maximal (and thus prime) $\ZZ[x]/\gens{2, x} \cong \ZZ/2$ is a field and a domain.
- Prime but not maximal: 
  - $\gens{0} \in \Id(\ZZ)$, since $m\ZZ \contains \gens{0}$ for any $m$.
  - $\gens{x} \in R[x]$ over any integral domain since $R[x]/\gens{x} \cong R$ is a domain (making it maximal), but $R$ can be chosen not to be a field (making it non-prime).
- Not prime, not maximal:
  - $m\ZZ \in \Id(\ZZ)$, since $m$ composite implies $\ZZ/m$ is not a domain since it has nonzero zero divisors. 
    For example, in $\ZZ/6$, $[3]$ is a zero divisors since $[2][3] = 0$.
- Useful examples:

A **division ring** is any (potentially noncommutative) ring $R$ for which $R\smz \subset \RR\units$, i.e. every nonzero element is a unit and thus has a multiplicative inverse.
:::

:::{.definition title="Zero Divisor"}
An element $r\in R$ is a **zero-divisor** iff there exists an $a\in R\smz$ such that $ar = ra = 0$, i.e. $r\divides 0$.
Equivalently, the map
\[  
r\cdot: R &\to R \\
x &\mapsto rx
\]

:::

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Suppose $\mfm \in \mspec R$ is a proper maximal ideal.
Show that under either of the following two conditions, $R$ is local:

- $R\sm \mfm \subseteq R\units$, so every element of $R\sm \mfm$ is a unit, or
- $1 + \mfm \subseteq R\units$

:::

:::{.solution}
- Sketch: $\mfm$ must contain every non-unit.
  - If $I \neq R$ then $I$ contains no units, so $I\subseteq N \da R\sm R\units$, i.e. $I$ is contained in the non-units.
    But $N \subseteq \mfm$ since no element of $\mfm$ is a unit and no element of $R\sm \mfm$ is a non-unit.

- Sketch: show that every $r\in R\sm \mfm$ is a unit and apply the first part.
  - If $r\in R\sm \mfm$ then $\gens{r, \mfm} = R = \gens{ 1 }$ so $rt + m = 1$ for some $t\in R, m\in \mfm$, so $rt = 1-m \in 1 + \mfm \subseteq R\units$ by assumption.
    Now apply (1).
:::

:::{.definition title="Dedekind Domains"}

Write $r = fp$ and $x = fq$ for $p, q\in R[x]$, show $\deg f = 0$ and $\deg q = 1$.

Fields $\subset$ Euclidean domains  $\subset$  PIDs $\subset$ UFDs $\subset$ Integral Domains  $\subset$ Rings
:::

:::{.remark}
Sketch proofs of the inclusions:

- Field $\implies$ Euclidean: given $x,y$ we need to write $x=qy+r$, so just take $q=y\inv$ and $r=0$.

- Euclidean $\implies$ PID: to divide is to contain, and the Euclidean algorithm terminates to yield a gcd.
  Alternatively, pick an element $a\in I$ of minimal degree. 
  If $I\neq Ra$ pick $b\in Ra$ that $a$ doesn't divide and write $b = aq + r$ with $d(r) < d(a)$.
  Then $r = b-aq \in I$. $\contradiction$

- PID $\implies$ UFD:
  - To get existence, use that PIDS are Noetherian, maximals are generated by irreducibles, and irreducibles are prime.
  Write $a =a_1 b_1$ a proper factorization to get a proper containment $\gens{a} \subset \gens{a_1}$ that eventually stabilizes to yield an irreducible factor $a_r$.
  Use the same idea to write $a$ as finitely many irreducible factors.
  - To get uniqueness, write $a = \prod p_i = \prod q_i$ as primes and divide everything over.

:::

:::{.example title="showing these inclusions are strict"}
\envlist

- A Euclidean Domain that is not a field: $k[x]$ for $k$ a field.
  - *Proof*: Use that $k$ a field implies $k[x]$ is a PID, and PID implies UFD.
    But this is not a field since the element $x$ is not invertible.

- A PID that is not a Euclidean Domain: $\ZZ\left[\frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2}\right]$.
  - *Proof*: complicated.

- A UFD that is not a PID: $\ZZ[x]$.
  - *Proof*: $\ZZ$ a UFD implies $\ZZ[x]$ is a UFD, but  $\gens{2, x} = 2\ZZ[x] + x\ZZ[x] = \ts{\sum r_ix^i \st r_0 \in 2\ZZ}$ is not principal. 
    Why: if $\gens{2, x} = \gens{f}$ and $f$ is constant, then every polynomial in this ideal has even coefficients and thus misses $g(x) \da x$.
    Otherwise, $\deg f \geq 1$ and we miss 2, which has degree zero.

-  An integral domain that is not a UFD: $\ZZ[\sqrt{-5}]$
   - *Proof*: $(2+\sqrt{-5})(2-\sqrt{-5})=9=3\cdot 3$, where all factors are irreducible (check norm).

-  A ring that is not an integral domain: $\ZZ/4$
   - *Proof*: $[2]_4$ is a zero divisor since $[2]_4 [2]_4 = [0]_4$.

Notation: let $N$ or $N(R)$ be the set of nilpotents in $R$.
Let $ZD$ or $ZD(R)$ be the set of zero divisors.
Let $U, U(R), R\units$ be the units of $R$.

- Show that every nilpotent is either zero or a zero divisor.
  - Solution: $a^m=0$ with $a\neq 0$ and $m>1$, then $x x^{m-1} = 0$, so $x^{m-1}$ is a nontrivial element annihilating $x$.
- Show that $R$ commutative and unital and $x$ nilpotent implies $1+x$ is a unit, and moreover $N + R\units = R\units$ (the sum of a nilpotent and unit is a unit).
  - Solution: expand $1/(1+x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-x)^k = \sum_{k=0}^n (-x)^k \da f(x)$, so $(1+x)f(x) =1$.
  Now use that $RN = N$ since $x^n=0$ implies $(rx)^n = rxrx\cdots rx = r^n x^n = 0$.
  Taking $n + u\in N + R\units$, then $u+n = u\inv(1 + u\inv n) \in R\units R\units$ since $u\inv n\in N$ and $1+u\inv\in R\units$ by the first part.

- Show that $f(x) = \sum a_k x^k \in R[x]$ iff $f\in R[x]\units \iff a_0\in R\units, a_{k>1}\in N$.
  - Solution: use that if $a_k$ is nilpotent, $a_k x^k$ is nilpotent.
    Then $a_0$ a unit at $a_1 x$ nilpotent implies $a_0 + a_1 x$ is a unit, and inductively $f$ is a unit.
    If $f$ is a unit, take $fg=1$ with $f = \sum_{k=0}^na_k x^k$ and $g = \sum_{k=0}^m a_k x^k$.
    Write $fg(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n+m} c_k x^k$ where $c_k = \sum_{j=0}^k a_j b_{k-j}$.
    Using $fg=1$, $c_{0} = a_0 b_0 = 1$ so $a_0, b_0$ are units, and proceed inductively by descending coefficients, checking that $a_n b_m$ is the $r=0$ case.

- Show that $f(x) \in N(R[x]) \iff a_k \in N(R)$ for all $k$.
  - Solution: $f$ nilpotent with $f(x) = \sum a_k x^k$ implies $f^m=0$, and check the leading term $a_n^m x^{nm}$.
    Induct down: $f, a_nx^n$ nilpotent implies $f - a_n x^n$ nilpotent.
    Conversely, if $a_i^{n_i} = 0$, use that $N(R) \normal R$ form an ideal.

- Show that $f\in ZD(R[x]) \iff f\neq 0$ and $rf(x) = 0$ for some $r\in R$.

(xr)^n = (xr)(xr)\cdots(xr) = x^n r^n = x^n 0 = 0
.\]

- $R^2 \subseteq R$, for $r,s\in \nilrad{R}$ write $r^{n} = s^m = 0$, then
\[
(r+s)^{N} = \sum_{k\geq 0}{N \choose k} r^k s^{N-k}
,\]
so just choose $N$ large enough so that either $k>n$ or $N-k> m$ always holds, e.g. $N\da n+m-1$.

- $R/\nilrad{R}$ has no nonzero nilpotents:
  Take $\bar{r} \in R/\nilrad{R}$ for some $r\in R$, then $\phi(r^n) = \phi(r)^n = \bar{r}^n$.
  So\[
\bar{r}^n=0 \mod \nilrad{R} \iff \bar{r^n} \equiv 0 \mod \nilrad{R} \iff r^n \in \nilrad{R} \iff r\in 0_R

$\nilrad{R} \subseteq P$:
Suppose $r\in \nilrad{R}$ so $r^n = 0$ and let $\mfp \in \spec R$.
Then use that $0\in I$ for any ideal: $r^n = 0 \in \mfp \implies r\in \mfp$ since $\mfp$ is prime.
\

$\nilrad{R}^c \subseteq P^c$:
Fix $f$ non-nilpotent, we want to show $f$ is not in any prime ideal.
set $S \subseteq R$ to be all ideals $I$ such that $f^{>0} \not \in I$.
Apply Zorn's lemma: $S\neq \emptyset$ since $0\in S$, so after ordering $I$ by inclusions $S$ contains a maximal $\mfp$ which we claim is prime.
If $a,b \in \mfp^c$ then $\mfp + \gens{ a }$ and $\mfp + \gens{b} supset \mfp$ strictly, and by maximality they aren't in $S$.
So there exist $m,n$ such that $f^m\in \mfp + \gens{ a }$ and $f^n \in \mfp + \gens{b}$. 
Then $f^{m+n} \in \mfp + \gens{ab}$, so $\mfp + \gens{ab}$ is not in $S$.
Thus $ab\not \in \mfp$ so $f\not\in \mfp$.
Letting $\mfp$ be arbitrary yields $f\not \in P$.

:::{.definition title="Chain in a poset"}
In a poset, a **chain** is a totally ordered subset.

Every ring has a proper maximal ideal, and any proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.

Every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.

:::{.proof}
Let $0 < I < R$ be a proper ideal, and consider the set
$$
S = \theset{J \suchthat I   \subseteq J < R}
.$$

Note $I\in S$, so $S$ is nonempty.
The claim is that $S$ contains a maximal element $M$.

$S$ is a poset, ordered by set inclusion, so if we can show that every chain has an upper bound, we can apply Zorn's lemma to produce $M$.

Let $C \subseteq S$ be a chain in $S$, so $C = \theset{C_1 \subseteq C_2 \subseteq \cdots}$ and define $\hat{C} = \union_i C_i$.

**$\hat{C}$ is an upper bound for $C$:**
This follows because every $C_i \subseteq \hat{C}$.

**$\hat{C}$ is in $S$:**
Use the fact that $I \subseteq C_i < R$ for every $C_i$ and since no $C_i$ contains a unit, $\hat{C}$ doesn't contain a unit, and is thus proper.

# General Field Theory


:::{.remark}
The most useful tricks of the trade:

- $\# \GG_m(\GF(p^k)) = p^k-1$, since every element is invertible except 0.
  You can use this to cook up strong numerical constraints on orders of elements.
  E.g. if $a^{17}=1$ in some finite field of size $p^k$, $o(a)$ divides 17 and $o(a)$ divides $p^{k}-1$, so $o(a)$ divides $\gcd(17, p^{k}-1)$.
- Multiplicativity in towers can force numerical divisibility constraints.
  E.g. if $\alpha$ is a root of any irreducible $f$, take the tower $\SF(\alpha, k)/k(\alpha)/k$: then the degree of $\min_{\alpha, k}(x)\in k[x]$ divides the degree of the extension $[\SF(\alpha, k) :  k]$.

Every field morphism is an embedding (injection).
An **embedding** of $k\dash$algebras $L\embeds L'$ will refer to any ring morphism over $k$, i.e. a field morphism that restricts to the identity on $k$:

:::{.definition title="Perfect Fields"}
The following are equivalent:

- $k$ is a **perfect** field.

- If $\ch k > 0$, the Frobenius is an automorphism of $k$, so $k^p = k$.

- Every finite extension $F/k$ is separable.

- Every irreducible polynomial $p\in k[x]$ is separable.

:::

:::{.example title="of a non-perfect field"}
Example of a non-perfect field: $\FF_p(t)$.
Use that $f(x) \da x^p - t$ is irreducible in $\FF_p(t)[x]$ but not separable.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Characterization of perfect fields"}
$k$ is perfect (using the irreducible implies separable condition) if either 

- $\ch k = 0$ or 
- $\ch k = p > 0$ and $k^p = k$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
For $\ch k = 0$, use that irreducible implies separable.

For $\ch k = p$, show that $k^p\neq k \iff$ irreducible does *not* imply separable, so there exists an inseparable irreducible.

- Supposing $k^p\neq k$, choose $a\in k$ not a $p$th power.
- Note that $f(x) \da x^p-a$ has only one root in $\bar{k}$: in a splitting field, any root $r$ satisfies $r^p=a$, so 
\[
x^p - a = x^p - r^p = (x-r)^p
.\]

- Note $f$ is irreducible: its only possible divisors are $(x-r)^m$ for $m \leq p$.
  Expanding yields 
  \[
(x-r)^m = \sum_{k=0}^m {m\choose k} x^{m-k} (-r)^{k} = x^m + {m\choose 1} x^{m-1} (-r)^m + \cdots
  ,\]
  so the coefficient of $x^{m-1}$ is $-mr \in k$.

- Thus if $(x-r)^m$ has a nontrivial divisor in $k[x]$ then $m$ must be in $k\units$, forcing $r\in k$.
  But then $r^p = a\in k$, $\contradiction$.

:::

:::{.corollary}
$x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i \in \FF_p[x]$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$.
:::

:::{.proof}
$\impliedby$:

- Suppose $f$ is irreducible of degree $d$.
- Then $f \divides x^{p^d} - x$, by considering $F[x]/\gens{f}$.
- Thus $x^{p^d} - x \divides x^{p^n} - x \iff d\divides n$.

$\implies$:

- $\alpha \in \GF(p^n) \iff \alpha^{p^n} - \alpha = 0$, so every element is a root of $\phi_n$ and $\deg \min(\alpha, \FF_p) \divides n$ since $\FF_p(\alpha)$ is an intermediate extension.

- So if $f$ is an irreducible factor of $\phi_n$, $f$ is the minimal polynomial of some root $\alpha$ of $\phi_n$, so $\deg f \divides n$.

-  $\phi_n'(x) = p^nx^{p^{n-1}} \neq 0$, so $\phi_n$ is squarefree and thus has no repeated factors. So $\phi_n$ is the product of all such irreducible $f$.

- $\phi(p) = p-1$, because every number $k\leq p-1$ is coprime to $p$.
- $\phi(p^k) = p^{k} - p^{k-1}$, since there are $p^k$ total numbers less than $p^k$, most of which are coprime to $p$.
  The ones to remove are those dividing $p^k$: the only divisors of $p^k$ are $p^\ell$ for $0\leq \ell \leq k$, and $\gcd(p^k, m) = p^\ell$ 
  whenever $m=tp$ for $t = 1,2,3,\cdots,p^{k-1}$ (i.e. $m$ is divisible by some power of $p$, so the $p^{k-1}$ multiples of $p$ are possible).

Show 
\[
x^\ell - 1 \divides x^m-1 \iff \ell\divides m
.\]
:::

:::{.solution}
$\implies$

- Write $m = \ell q + r$ with $0\leq r < \ell$.
- Write 
\[
p(x) = {x^m-1 \over x^\ell - 1}
= {x^{lq+r} -1 \over x^\ell - 1}
= x^r{x^{lq} - 1 \over x^\ell - 1} + {x^r - 1 \over x^\ell - 1}
= q(x) + {x^r-1 \over x^\ell - 1}
,\]
where $p,q$ are polynomial by divisibility.
- So the remaining ratio must be polynomial, but since $r<\ell$ is strict this forces $r=0$.
  Thus $\ell \divides m$.

\todo[inline]{I don't like this proof!}


$\impliedby$:

- Write $m = \ell q + r$, then $r=0$ by divisibility.
- Then $x^m-1 = x^{\ell q} - 1 \da z^q-1$ where $z\da x^\ell$. 
- Use that $z-1 \divides z^q - 1$, so $x^{\ell}-1 \divides x{\lq} -1 = x^m-1$.

:::

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Show that if $f \in \FF_p[x]^{\irr}$ is degree $d$,
\[
f \divides x^{p^n}-x \iff d\divides n
.\]
:::

:::{.solution}
$\impliedby$:

- If $d\divides n$, $x^d-1 \divides x^n-1$ by a previous exercise, and so $p^d-1 \divides p^n-1$.
- So $x^{p^d-1} \divides x^{p^n-1}$, now multiply through by $x$.
- Claim: $f \divides x^{p^d-1}$, from which the result immediately follows.
- For $\alpha$ any root of $f$, $\FF_p(\alpha)$ is a finite field of size $p^d$ since $[\FF_p(\alpha):\FF_p] = d$.
- So $\FF_p(\alpha)\cong \GF(p^d)$, which is the splitting field of $x^{p^d}-x$.
- Thus $\alpha$ is a root of $x^{p^d}-x$.
  Iterating over all roots yields the divisibility statement.

$\implies$:

- If $f\divides g_n(x) \da x^{p^n}-x$, then every root $\alpha$ of $f$ is a root of $g_n$.
- So $\FF_p(\alpha) \subseteq \GF(p^n)$.
- The result follows from the computation
\[
n &= [\GF(p^n) : \FF_p] \\
&= [\GF(p^n) : \FF_p(\alpha)] \cdot [\FF_p(\alpha) : \FF_p] \\
&= kd

$\GF(p^n)$ is a simple extension over $\FF_p$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Algebraic Extension"}
A field extension $L/k$ is **algebraic** iff every $\alpha \in L$ is the root of some polynomial $f\in k[x]$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Finite Extensions are Algebraic"}
Every finite extension is algebraic.
:::

:::{.proof title="that finite extensions are algebraic"}
If \( K/F \) and \( [K:F] = n \), then pick any \( \alpha \in K \) and consider \( 1, \alpha , \alpha ^2, ...  \).
This yields \( n+1 \) elements in an \( n\dash \)dimensional vector space, and thus there is a linear dependence 
\[
f(\alpha ) \da \sum_{j=1}^n c_j \alpha ^j = 0
.\]
But then \( \alpha \) is the root of the polynomial \( f \).

:::

## Normal Extensions

:::{.definition title="Normal Field Extension"}
Let $L/k$ be an extension.
Then TFAE:

- $L/k$ is **normal**.

- Every irreducible polynomial $f\in k[x]$ that has one root in $L$ has *all* of its roots in $L$, and thus splits in $L[x]$.
  - So if $\alpha\in L$ then every Galois conjugate $\alpha_k \in L$ as well..
   Thus either $f$ splits in $L$ or $f$ has no roots in $L$.

:::

:::{.example title="of normal extensions"}
\envlist

- Useful trick: if $[L: k] = 2$ then $L/k$ is automatically normal.

- Useful trick: if $L/K/k$, then $K/k$ is normal iff $\Gal(L/K) \normal \Gal(L/k)$.

- $K \da \QQ(2^{1\over 3})$ is not normal, since $K\subset \RR$ but $(x^3-2) = \prod_k x-\zeta_3^k 2^{1\over 3}$ with $\zeta_3, \zeta_3^2 \in \CC$.
  - Another reason: an embedding $\sigma: K\to \bar k$ can send $2^{1\over 3}$ to any other root of $x^3-2$.

- $\QQ(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3)$ is normal over $\QQ$, since it it is finite and splits $f(x) \da (x^2-2)(x^2-3)$, which is a separable polynomial.

- $L \da \QQ(2^{1\over 4})$ is not normal, since it is finite but not the splitting field of any polynomial.

- $\QQ(\zeta_k)$ is normal for $\zeta_k$ any primitive $k$th root of unity.


- A normal non-separable extension: $\FF_p(x, y) \slice{\FF_p (x^p, y^p)}$.
  This has finite degree $p^2$ but infinitely many subfields?

:::

:::{.proposition title="Characterization of finite normal extensions as splitting fields"}
An extension $L/k$ is finite and normal $\iff L$ is the splitting field of some polynomial $f\in k[x]$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
$\implies$:

- Write $L = k(a_1, \cdots, a_n)$ by finiteness.
- Let $m_i$ be the minimal polynomials of the $a_i$.
- By normality, the $m_i$ split in $L[x]$.
- Then $L$ is the splitting field of $f(x) \da \prod_i m_i(x)$.

$\impliedby$:

- Suppose $L/k = \SF(f)$, and pick any monic $m\in L[x]^{\irr}$ with a root $a\in L$, so that $m$ is the minimal polynomial of $a$.
- Toward showing $m$ splits in $L$: let $M = \SF(m)$, we'll show $M=L$.
- To show that for any root $b\in M$ we have $b\in L$, it suffices to show $[L(b): L] = 1$.

  The strategy: use that $[L(a):L] = 1$ since $a\in L$ by assumption, and try to relate the two degrees.

- We have $L/k$, and a number of towers to work with:
\[
[L(a):k] &= [L(a): k(a)] [k(a): k] &= [L(a) : L] [L: k] \\ \\
[L(b):k] &= [L(b): k(b)] [k(b): k] &= [L(b) : L] [L: k]
.\]

- In the first set of equalities, note that $k(a)\slice{k} \cong k(b)\slice{k}$ since $a,b$ are conjugate roots over $k$.
  Moreover $L(a)\slice{k(a)} \cong L(b) \slice{k(b)}$ since both are splitting fields for $f$.

- Thus $[L(a):k] = [L(b): k]$, which forces $[L(a): L] = [L(b): L]$ after dividing by $[L:k]$.
  But $[L(a): L] = 1$.

$f$ is separable iff $\gcd(f, f')=1$, so $f, f'$ share no common roots.
Moreover, the multiple roots of $f$ are precisely the roots of $\gcd(f, f')$.
:::

:::{.proof title="of separability test"}
$\not\implies$:
Suppose $f$ has a repeated root $r_i$, so its multiplicity is at least 2.
Then 
\[
f(x) = (x-r)^2 g(x) \implies f'(x) = 2(x-r)g(x) + (x-r)^2g'(x)

so $r$ is a root of $f'$.

$\not\impliedby$:
Suppose $r$ is a root of $f, f'$.
Write $f(x) = (x-r)p(x)$ and $f'(x) = (x-r)p'(x) + p(x)$.
Rearranging, $f'(x) - (x-r)p'(x) = p(x)$, and since $r$ is a root of the LHS it's a root of the RHS.
So $p(x) = (x-r) q(x)$ and $f(x) = (x-r)^2 q(x)$, making $r$ a repeated root.

Assume $f$ is monic, then $f$ is inseparable iff $f, f'$ have a common root $a$.
So $(x-a)\divides q\da \gcd(f, f')$, and since $f$ is irreducible, it must be the minimal polynomial of $a$.
Since $f'(a) = 0$, this forces $f'\divides f$, and since $\deg f' = \deg f - 1 < \deg f$ this forces $f' \equiv 0$.

:::{.proposition title="Derivative completely detects separability"}
\envlist

- For any field $k$, $f\in k[x]$ is separable $\iff f'\not\equiv 0 \in k[x]$.
- For $\ch k = 0$, irreducible implies separable.
- For $\ch k = p$, irreducibles $f(x)$ are inseparable iff $f(x) = g(x^p)$ for some $g\in k[x]$.


Thus for an irreducible polynomial $f$,
\[
f\text{ separable} \iff \gcd(f, f')=1 \iff f'\not\equiv 0 \iff_{\ch k = p} f(x) = g(x^p)
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
- First part:
  - $\not A\implies \not B$: 
    - Let $f$ be irreducible, and suppose $f$ is separable.
      If $d(x) \da \gcd(f, f') \neq 1$, then $f'$ can not divide $f$ since $f$ is irreducible, so $f$ divides $f'$.
      But $\deg f' < f$ and $f\divides f'$ forces $f'\equiv 0$.
  - $\not B \implies \not A$:
    - If $f'\equiv 0$, then $d(x) \da \gcd(f, f') = \gcd(f, 0) = f \neq 1$ and $f$ is *not* separable.

- Second part:
  - If $\ch k = 0$ and $f$ is irreducible, then $\deg f \geq 2$ and $\deg f' \geq 1$ so $f' \neq 0$ and $f$ is thus separable.

- Third part:
  - $\impliedby$: If $f(x) = g(x^p)$ then $f'(x) = g'(x^p)\cdot px^{p-1}\equiv 0$.
  - $\implies$: Let $f$ be irreducible and inseparable, so $f' \equiv 0 \in k[x]$.
    Then $f(x) \da \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k$ implies $f'(x) \da \sum_{k=1}^{n}ka_k x^{k-1}$, which is zero iff $ka_k \equiv 0$ so $p$ divides $ka_k$.
    So $a_k\not\equiv 0$ forces $p\divides k$, so $f = a_0 + a_px^p + a_{2p}x^{2p} + \cdots$.

:::{.corollary title="Inseparable iff polynomial in characteristic powers"}
If $f\in k[x]^{\irr}$ and $p\da \ch k > 0$, then $f$ inseparable $\iff f(x) = q(x^{p^n})$ for some unique $n$.
:::

:::{.proof title="of inseparable characterization"}
$\implies$:

Use that $f$ is inseparable iff $f' \equiv 0$.
The claim is that $f' \equiv 0$ in characteristic $p$ iff all exponents present in $f$ are divisible by $p$.
If $f'\equiv 0$, write
\[
f(x) &= a_nx^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \\
\implies f'(x) &= na_nx^{n-1} + (n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1 \\
&\equiv 0
,\]
which forces $i a_i = 0$ for all $i$.
For any $a_i\neq 0$, this forces $i\equiv 0 \mod p$, so $a_i$ can only be nonzero when $p\divides i$, so $i=kp$ for some $k$.
So reindex to write
\[
f(x) = a_0 + a_1x^p + a_2x^{2p} + \cdots + a_n x^{np} = \qty{b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^{2} + \cdots + b_nx^{n}}^p \in \bar{k}[x]
,\]
using $(c+d)^p = c^p + d^p$ in characteristic $p$, and taking $b_i \da a_i^{1\over p} \in \bar{k}$
So $f' \equiv 0\implies f(x) = q(x^p)$ where $q(t) \da \sum b_i t^i$.

$\impliedby$:
If $f(x) = q(x^p)$ for some $q$, the previous calculation shows $q$ has multiple roots, thus so does $f$, so $f$ is inseparable.
:::

:::{.fact title="Irreducible implies separable in characteristic zero"}
If $\ch k = 0$ and $f\in k[x]^{\irr}$, then $f$ is automatically separable.

Why this is true: assuming $f$ is irreducible, $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ or $f$.
It can't be $f$, since $f\divides f'$ would force $\deg f = \deg f' = 0$ and make $f$ a constant.
So this $\gcd$ is 1.

- Use that irreducible polynomial $f$ must have distinct roots, by the argument above.

- Toward a contradiction, suppose $f$ is irreducible but inseparable.
- Then $f(x) = g(x^p)$ for some $g(x) \da \sum a_k x^k$.
- Since Frobenius is bijective, write $a_k = b_k^p$ for some $b_k$, then
\[
f(x) = \sum a_k x^{pk} = \sum b_k^p x^{pk} =\qty{ \sum b_k x^k }^p

  - Since $K \subseteq L$, any $\alpha \in K$ is also separable over $k$.
- $L/K$ is separable:
  - If $\alpha \in L$, then $\min_{\alpha, k}(x)$ is a separable polynomial over some splitting field.
  - Use that $L/k$ implies $\min_{\alpha, L}(x)$ divides $\min_{\alpha, k}(x)$, so the former is separable, done.

This is well-defined since by normality $\sigma(K) = K$.
Any $f\in \ker \rho$ is the identity on $K$, so $f\in \Gal(L/K)$ and $\ker \phi = H$.
Since $L/K$ is Galois, every $f\in \Gal(K/k)$ lifts to $\Gal(L/k)$, making $\rho$ surjective.

## Quadratic Extensions

:::{.proposition title="Classification of quadratic extensions"}
If $\FF$ is a field with $\ch(\FF)\neq 2$ and $E_{/\FF}$ is a degree 2 extension, then $E$ is Galois and $E = F(\sqrt{a})$ for some squarefree $a\in \FF$.
:::

:::{.corollary title="Quadratic extensions of rationals"}
If $E_{/\QQ}$ is a quadratic extension, $E = \QQ(\sqrt q)$ for some $q\in \QQ$ squarefree.
Explicitly, use the primitive element theorem to write $E = \QQ(\alpha)$, let $f$ be the minimal polynomial, then take $q=b^2-4ac$.
One can do slightly better by writing $b^2-4ac = a/b$ so that $\sqrt{b^2-4ac}=\sqrt{ab}/b$ and taking $q=ab$.

For $\FF_p$ a finite field of prime order, all quadratic extensions $E/\FF_p$ are isomorphic.

A collection of field extensions $\mathcal{S}$ is **distinguished** iff

1. (Transitive property) For any tower $L/K/k$, the extension $L/k \in \mathcal{S} \iff L/K \in \mcs$ (upper transitivity) and $K/k\in \mathcal{S}$ (lower transitivity):

:::

:::{.example title="of distinguished classes"}
The following classes of extensions are distinguished:

- Algebraic.
- Finite.
- Separable.
- Purely inseparable.
- Finitely generated.
- Solvable.

:::

:::{.warnings}
Normal extensions are *not* distinguished, since they fail the forward implication for (lower) transitivity.
However, they do have the (forward implication) upper transitive, lifting, and compositing properties.

As a consequence, Galois extensions are also not distinguished.
:::

:::{.fact title="Normal/Algebraic/Galois extensions are upper transitive"}
For $L/F/k$: $L/k$ normal/algebraic/Galois $\implies L/F$ normal/algebraic/Galois.

### Algebraic Extensions

:::{.proposition title="Transitivity of algebraic extensions, forward implication"}
If $L/K/k$ (not necessarily finite) with $L/K$ and $K/k$ both algebraic, then $L/k$ is algebraic.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
\envlist

- We want to show every $\alpha \in L$ is algebraic over $k$, and it suffices to show $\alpha$ is algebraic over some finite subextension $k(S)$.
- Pick $\alpha\in L$, then $\alpha$ is algebraic over $K$ by assumption, so it is a root of some $f\in K[x]$.
- Let $S$ be the finitely many coefficients of $f$, then $\alpha$ is algebraic over $k(S)$.
- Note that $k(S)/k$ is finite and thus algebraic, and $k(S,\alpha)/k(s)$ is finite and also algebraic, so we're reduced to the finite case.
- It suffices to show $k(S, \alpha)/k(s)/k$ is finite, which follows from multiplicativity of degrees.
:::


:::{.remark}
If $L/K/k$ with $\alpha$ algebraic over $L$, then $\alpha$ is algebraic over $K$ and $\min_{\alpha, L}$ divides $\min_{\alpha, K}$ (so minimal polynomials only get smaller in extensions).

#### Issues with Normal Towers


:::{.example title="Normal extensions are not transitive: failure of lower transitivity, forward implication"}
One can similarly produce towers where the total extension is normal but the lower iterate is not normal: take
\[
L/K/k \da \QQ(2^{1\over 3}, \zeta_3) / \QQ(2^{1\over 3}) / \QQ
.\]
Now $K/k$ isn't normal, since $\Gal(L/k) = S_3$ but $\Gal(L/K) = \ZZ/2 \not\normal S_3$.

Another example: let $L/k$ be any algebraic extension that isn't normal, and take $N_k$ to be the normal closure to get $N_k/L$. 
Concretely, $N_\QQ / \QQ(2^{1\over 3})/\QQ$ works.
:::

:::{.example title="Normal extensions are not transitive: failure of reverse implication"}
One can produce towers of successively normal extensions whose total extension is not normal in a cheap way:
take 
\[
L/K/k \da \QQ(2^{1\over 4}) / \QQ(2^{1\over 2}) / \QQ
.\]
Each iterate is normal since it's quadratic, but the overall extension misses complex roots and is thus not normal.

\envlist

- Use the fact that for finite extensions, $L/k$ is normal and separable $\iff L$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial $f\in k[x]$.
- Now regard $f$ as a polynomial in $K[x]$; then $L$ is still the splitting field of $f$ over $K$, done.

Alternatively,

- Let $\alpha\in L$ be a root of $f\in K[x]$ with $f$ irreducible, it suffices to show all roots of $f$ are in $L$.
- Let $m\in K[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $K$, and let $m'\in k[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $k$.
- Since $L/k$ is normal and $\alpha\in L$, $m'$ splits in $L$.
- Minimal polynomials are divisible in towers, so $m$ divides $m'$.
  Since $m'$ splits in $L$, so must $m$.

# Galois Theory

> Some useful exercises and solutions: <https://feog.github.io/chap4.pdf>

:::{.remark}
\envlist

- Given $x\da \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$, to find a minimal polynomial consider $x^2, x^3,\cdots$ and try to get a linear combination.
  Then check if its irreducible.
  - General strategy here: try to isolate radicals on one side, then raise both sides to that power.

- To find a minimal polynomial for an element $\alpha$, figure out the dimension of $\QQ(\alpha)/\QQ$ -- say it's $n$, then $1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^n$ must be a $\QQ\dash$linearly dependent set, so you compute these powers and fiddle with $\QQ$ coefficients (or invert a matrix).
- Useful trick: for $x \da \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$, compute $x,x^2, x^3, x^4$ and write them in terms of the basis $\ts{1, \sqrt{a}, \sqrt{b}, \sqrt{ab}}$.
 Then put this linear system into a matrix and invert:
 \[
   A\vector v = \vector c \da A \tv{1, \sqrt a, \sqrt b, \sqrt{ab} } = \tv{x, x^2, x^3, x^4}
 .\]
 Once you get $A\inv \vector x = \vector b$, read off the first row dotted against $\vector b$ to get a polynomial in $x$.
 - In general: take $\alpha$, sort out the degree $n$ of the extension $\QQ(\alpha)/\QQ$, and use the basis $1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots, \alpha^{n-1}$.

- A trick to remember how degrees, indices and sizes match up: $L/K/F$ corresponds to $1/H/G$, and $[L:K] = [H:1] = \# H$, $[F:K] = [G:H]$, $[L:F] = [G:1] = \# G$, etc.

- Trick: once you find $\SF(f)/\QQ$, if any subextension is not normal over $\QQ$, then $G$ can not be abelian.
  - Example: $f(x) = x^3-2$ splits in $\QQ(\zeta_3, 2^{1\over 3})$ which has a non-normal subextension $\QQ(2^{1\over 3})$, forcing $G= S_3$.

- If $\alpha\beta \in \QQ$, then $\alpha \in \QQ(\beta)$ and vice-versa (I think).

:::

:::{.remark}
Assume all extensions here are algebraic and finite.
Let $f\in \QQ[x]$ with $n \da \deg f$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="The Algorithm"}
\envlist

- Show your extension is Galois (normal and separable)
  - Show $f$ is irreducible and separable.
- Find the degree of the extension $d$, since then $\# G = d$.
  - Note that in general, $G\leq S_n$ and $n\neq d$, $\# G\neq n$.
- Obtain $n\divides d \da \# G \divides n!$ and $G\leq S_n$ is a transitive subgroup, list possibilities.
- Rule out cases or determine the group completely by finding cycle types.

:::

:::{.example title="Of using the algorithm"}
Consider $f(x) \da x^5-9x+3$, let $L\da \SF(f)/\QQ$.

- $f$ is irreducible:
  Apply Eisenstein with $p=3$.
- $f$ is separable:
  - $\QQ$ is perfect, so irreducible implies separable.
- $L$ is Galois:
  - $L/\QQ$ is a finite extension over a perfect field and thus automatically separable.
  - $L/\QQ$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, and thus normal.
- Since $L$ is Galois, $\# G = d \da [L: \QQ]$, so try to compute the degree by computing the splitting field (and its degree) explicitly.
  - Here: difficult! The roots are complicated.
- Since $L$ is Galois, $G\leq S_5$ is a transitive subgroup.
  Possibilities: 
  \[
  S_5, A_5 , F_5\cong C_5\rtimes C_4, D_5, C_5
  .\]
- Claim: $G = S_5$.
  - Reduce mod 2: $(x^2 + x + 1) (x^3 + x^2 + 1)$, yielding a cycle type $(2, 3)$.
  This rules out 
    - $C_5, D_5$ since $3\notdivides 5, 10$.
    - $A_5$, since this is an odd number of even length cycles.
    - $F_5$ since $3\notdivides 20$.
  - So this only leaves $S_5$.

## Showing Extensions are Galois

:::{.fact}
Showing your polynomial is irreducible:

- Eisenstein (including shifting/inverting tricks, see section below)
- To show $f$ is irreducible, it suffices to show it is irreducible over any $\FF_p[x]$.
- A quadratic with no real roots is irreducible.

Showing your polynomial is separable:

- Show directly that $f$ has distinct roots in $\bar{k}$ by factoring it.
- For perfect fields, irreducibles are automatically separable.
- For $f$ irreducible, $f$ is separable iff $f'(x) \not\equiv 0$.

Showing your *extension* is separable:

- Splitting fields of separable polynomials are automatically separable *and* normal (and thus Galois).
- Algebraic extensions of a perfect field are automatically separable.
  - In particular, extensions over $\QQ$ or any $\ch k = 0$ are separable, and one only needs to show normality.
- (Hard) Show $[L:k]_s = [L:k]$.
- (Hard) Use that separability is a distinguished class.

Showing your extension is normal:

- Show that $L/k$ is finite and the splitting field of some separable polynomial.

Showing your extension $K/k$ is Galois: 

- Show normality and separability.
- Show $K$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial ("separable splitting field")
- Automatic when $K/k$ is algebraic and a finite field, since it's the splitting field of $x^{p^n}-x$.

## Irreducibility

:::{.proposition title="Consequence of Chebotarev density: checking irreducibility mod $p$"}
If $f\in \ZZ[x]$ is monic and there exists any prime $p$ such that $f\mod p$ is irreducible in $\FF_p[x]$, then $f$ irreducible in $\QQ[x]$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Finding a good prime for this is hard, but irreducibility can be checked exhaustively in small fields: just enumerate all polynomials and try polynomial long division.
:::

:::{.example title="using irreducibility mod $p$"}
$f(x) \da x^4 + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\ZZ[x]$, since checking manually in $\FF_2[x]$ shows that $0, 1$ are not roots $\mod 2$ so there is not linear factor.
Manually dividing $a_1 x^2 + a_2 x + a_3$ for $a_i\in 0, 1$ leaves remainders, so there are no quadratic factors.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Eisenstein's Criterion"}
If \[
f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i x^i = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \in \QQ[x]
.\]
then $f$ will be irreducible over $\QQ[x]$ (and thus over $\ZZ[x]$ by Gauss' lemma) if
$\exists p$ such that

- $p$ divides every coefficient *except* $a_n$ and
- $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$.

Note that if $f$ is monic, it suffices to find any prime dividing all of the non-leading terms.
:::

:::{.remark title="Shifting"}
If $f(x+a)$ satisfies Eisenstein for any $p$, then $f$ is irreducible.
This is generally because $\Delta_{f(x)} = \Delta_{f(x + a)}$, and if $p$ works for Eisenstein on any $f$ then $p\divides \Delta_f$.
:::

:::{.example title="of shifting"}
Set $f(x) \da x^2+x+2$, then $f(x+3) = x^2 + 7x + 14$ and Eisenstein applies at $p=7$.

:::

:::{.remark title="Inverting"}
If $n \da \deg(f)$ and $x^n f(1/x)$ is irreducible, then $f$ is irreducible.
Note that this is just reversing the coefficients.
:::

:::{.example title="Of inverting"}
Take $f(x) \da 2x^5 -4x^2-3$, then for $g(x) \da 3x^5 +4x^2 - 2$ Eisenstein applies with $p=2$.
:::


:::{.remark title="mod $p$ reduction checks to find a good $p$ for Eisenstein"}
If $f(x) \equiv b(x+a)^n\mod p$ for some $p$ where $n\da \deg f$, then Eisenstein may work on $f(x-a)$ using the prime $p$.
Note the change in signs/reverse translation.

In other words, reduce mod $p$ for various $p$, and if any $p$ collapses $f$ to a power of a linear factor, use that $p$ for Eisenstein.

Check
\[
f(x) \da x^3 + x^2 -48 x + 128 \leadsto f(x)\equiv (x-3)^3 \mod 5

## Computing

### Misc Useful Facts

Once you've confirmed that you have a Galois extension, some useful tricks are available:

:::{.fact title="Degrees of extensions"}
\envlist

- The size $\# G(f)$ is the degree $[\SF(f) : \QQ]$.
- The degree of $[\QQ(\alpha): \QQ]$ is the degree of $\min_{\alpha}(x)$, or any irreducible polynomial with $\alpha$ as a root.
  - Note that $\QQ(\alpha)\neq \SF(f)$ in general.
- If $f=\prod(x-r_i)$, then $\SF(f)$ contains every $\QQ(r_i)$.
  Thus 
  \[
[\QQ(r_i) : \QQ] = d \implies
d\divides [\SF(f): \QQ]
  .\]
  - Note that $d\neq \deg f$ in general!

:::

:::{.fact title="Random tricks"}
\envlist

- Reminder of rational roots test: for $f(x) = a_nx^n + \cdots + a_0$, rational roots are of the form $p_0/p_n$ where $p_i \divides a_i$.
- $\Gal(L/k)$ permutes the roots of any irreducible polynomial in $k[x]$.
  In particular, if $L=\SF(f)$ with $f$ reducible, then $G$ must send roots of irreducible factors to conjugates of the same factor.
- $\QQ(\zeta_a) = \QQ(\zeta_b) \iff a = 2b$ and $b$ is odd.
- If there are $k$ complex conjugate pairs (accounting for $2k$ roots) then $G$ contains a cycle $(1,2)(3,4)\cdots(2k-1,2k)$.
- If all exponents are even, $f(r) = 0 \iff f(-r) = 0$, so roots occur in pairs $(r, -r)$.
  - Pairs are preserved by $G$ in the sense that every $\sigma\in G$ satisfies either $\ts{r, -r}\mapsto \ts{r, -r}$ or $\ts{r, -r} \mapsto \ts{s, -s}$ for another pair.
  - Example: $x^4-5x^2+5$ has two pairs.
:::


### Transitive Subgroups

:::{.proposition title="Galois groups are transitive subgroups"}
If $f\in k[x]$ is irreducible, then $\Gal(\SF(f)/k) \leq S_n$ is **always** a transitive subgroup, i.e. it acts transitively on the set of roots.
:::

:::{.corollary}
\[
n\divides \# \Gal(K/\QQ) \divides n!
.\]

Why: $\Gal(K/\QQ) \cong G\leq S_n$, and Lagrange yields $\#H \divides n!$.
Note that $G$ acts on $R$ the set of $n$ roots, and since it acts transitively, $R$ is a single orbit.
By orbit stabilizer, $\OO_r \cong G/\Stab_G(r)$ and thus
\[
\# G = \# \OO_r \cdot \# \Stab_G(r)
,\]
so both terms on the right-hand side patently divide $\# G$
:::

:::{.fact title="Table of transitive subgroups of $S_n$ for qual-sized $n$"}
Write $C_n$ for the cyclic group of order $n$.
The following are transitive subgroups of $S_n$ for small $n$, where blue groups are nonabelian:

| $n \text{ in }S_n$ | Transitive Subgroups        | Sizes |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| 1            | 1                                 |1      |
| 2            | $S_2 \cong C_2$                   |2      |
| 3            | ${\color{blue}S_3\cong D_3}, A_3 \cong C_3$              |6,3    |
| 4            | ${\color{blue}S_4, A_4, D_4}, C_4, C_2^2$       |24,12,8,4,4 |
| 5            | ${\color{blue}S_5, A_5 , F_5\cong C_5\semidirect C_4, D_5}, C_5$ | 120,60,20,10,5 |

Other useful facts:

- $\# D_n = 2n$, $\#S_n = n!, \# A_n = n!/2$, and $\# F_5 = 20$.
- For degree 8 extensions (which sometimes arise as quadratic extensions of degree 4 extensions): 
  $Q_8 \leq S_8$ is transitive and nonabelian of order 8, and has presentation
\[
Q_{8}=\left\langle\alpha, \beta \mid \alpha^{4}=\beta^{4}=1, \alpha \beta \alpha=\beta, \beta^{2}=\alpha^{2}\right\rangle
.\]
  Note that $Q_8 \leq S_8$ but $Q_8\not\leq S_{<7}$.

- $F_5$ has presentation 
\[
\gens{a,b \st a^5, b^4, bab\inv = a^2}
.\]

:::{.remark title="Distinguishing groups"}
\envlist
By $n$ in $G\leq S_n$:

$n=4$:

- $C_2^2$ vs $C_4$: 

  - $C_2^2$ has two elements of order 2, the latter does not.
    So a cycle of type $(2, 2)$ forces $C_2^2$.

- $S_4$ vs $A_4$: 

  - $S_4$ contains a Sylow-2 subgroup of order 8 (which divides $4! = 24$) but $A_4$ does not since it's of order $4!/2 = 12$ and $8\not\divides 12$.
  - If $G$ contains a transposition, then $G= S_4$ or $D_4$, since $A_4$ doesn't contain a transposition.

- $D_4$ vs $Q_8$:

- 5 roots:
  - $S_5$ is generated by any transposition and any 5-cycle.
  - $S_n$ is generated by $(a,b)$ and $(1,2,\cdots,n) \iff \gcd(b-a, n) = 1$.
    In particular, the $(1, 2)$ and any length $n$ cycle works.

:::


:::{.fact title="Recognizing cycle types"}
The following are the cycle types that can occur:

- ![$G\leq S_4$](figures/2021-08-09_14-39-07.png)

:::


:::{.proposition title="Recognizing $A_n$ or $S_n$"}
Useful fact: if $G \leq S_n$ for $n$ prime contains a 2-cycle and a $p\dash$cycle, then $G\cong S_n$.
Note that for $n$ not prime, a transposition and an $n\dash$cycle isn't enough, since one needs the specific $n\dash$cycle $(1,2,\cdots,n)$ in general.

If $n>2$ and $G$ contains a 3-cycle and an $n\dash$cycle, then $G = A_n$ or $S_n$.
Note that by Orbit-Stabilizer $n\divides \# G$, and if $n$ is prime then by Cauchy there is an $n\dash$cycle (but this is not always the case).
In fact, it suffices to find a $k\dash$cycle for any $k\geq n/2$, which can be found by reducing mod $p$ and examining cycle types.

Moreover, if $G$ contains a 2-cycle (transposition), then $G = S_n$.
:::


:::{.remark title="Other useful facts to reason about $A_n$"}
\envlist

- Alternating groups have even numbers of cycles of even length.
- Elements in $A_n$ either have cycle type with an even number of even lengths (including 0).

### Density: Cycle Types

:::{.proposition title="A consequence of Chebotarev Density: reading cycles from reduction mod $p$"}
For any $p\not\divides \Delta$, writing $f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^m f_i(x) \mod p$, $G$ contains a cycle of type $(\deg f_1, \deg f_2, \cdots, \deg f_m)$.
Equivalently, if $\tilde f \da f\mod p$, then $G(\tilde f) \leq G(f)$ is a subgroup.
:::

:::{.warnings}
Warning: this only works if the $f_i$ are distinct, i.e. there are no repeated factors in the factorization $\mod p$.
:::

:::{.example title="Ruling out choices by existence of cycle types"}
You can use this to rule out types of groups using Lagrange's theorem: if you find a cycle of length $m$ which doesn't divide $\# H$, then $H$ isn't a possibility!
Example: $\deg f=5$ with exactly one conjugate pair of roots, then there is a 5-cycle $\sigma \da (1,2,3,4,5)$ because $5\divides \# G$ and a 2-cycle $\tau \da (1,2)$ coming from complex conjugation.
There check that $a_1 \da \sigma \tau \sigma\inv = (1, 5)$ and $a_1 \tau = (1, 5, 2)$ is a 3-cycle, so $3\divides \# G$.
This rules out $F_5$ which is of order 20, since $3\not\divides 20$.
:::

:::{.example title="Finding cycle types by reducing mod $p$"}
Consider $f(x) = x^5+2x+1$.
Reducing to $\FF_3$ yields no roots, so $f$ is irreducible, and moreover $G(f)$ contains a 5-cycle.
Reducing to $\FF_7$ splits $f$ as $(x+2)(x+3)(x^3+2x^2+5x+5)$, so $G(f)$ contains a 3-cycle.

:::

:::{.example title="of using density"}
Take $f(x) \da x^6 + x^4 + x + 3$, then

\[
f(x) &\equiv (x+1)(x^2 + \cdots)(x^3 + \cdots) \mod 2 &\implies \text{type } (1,2,3) \in G \\
f(x) &\equiv x(x+2)(x^4 + \cdots) \mod 3 &\implies \text{type } (1,1,4) \in G \\
.\]
:::

:::{.example title="of using density"}
Take $f(x) \da x^4+x+1$, then
\[
f(x) &\equiv x^4+x+1 \mod 2 &\implies \text{type } (4) \\
f(x) &\equiv (x-1)(x^3+x^2+x-1) \mod 3 &\implies \text{type } (1,3) \\
.\]

So $G$ contains a 4-cycle and a 3-cycle.
This is enough to show $G = A_4$.


:::

:::{.example title="?"}
Let $f(x) = x^6 + x^4 + x + 3$, reduce $\mod 11$ to get a cycle type $(1, 5)$.
So $G\leq S_6$ contains a 5-cycle, where $5>n/2 \da 6/2=3$, meaning $G = A_n, S_n$.
Now reduce $\mod p$ for various $p$ to look for a cycle type of the form $(2,1,1,\cdots)$ or $(3,1,1,\cdots)$.
This is hard, but $f\mod 2$ has type $(1,2,3)$ and $\qty{ (a,b)(c,d,e) }^3 = (a, b)$, so $G$ contains a transposition and thus $G = S_n = S_6$.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
Let $f(x) = x^7-x-1$, reduce $\mod 2$ to get a 7-cycle, and $\mod 3$ to get $(2, 5)$.
Then use $(2, 5)^5 = (2,1,1,\cdots)$ to get a transposition, So $G = S_7$.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
Let $f(x) \da x^7-7x+10$.
Reducing $\mod 3$ yields $(2, 5)$ and $(2, 5)^5 = (2, \cdots)$ and have a transposition.
Since $5>n/2=7/2$, $G = S_7$.

:::

### Discriminants

:::{.definition title="Discriminant"}
For $f = \sum a_k x^k$ monic,
\[
\Delta_f = \prod_{i < j} (r_i - r_j)^2
.\]

Note that $\Delta = 0$ when $f$ has a repeated root.

For cubics, 

- $\Delta > 0 \implies 3$ distinct real roots
- $\Delta < 0 \implies 1$ real root and 1 conjugate pair.
:::

:::{.example title="How to actually write this product"}
For $f$ a cubic:
\[
\Delta_f 
&= (r_1 - r_2)^2 (r_1 - r_3 )^2 \\
&\quad (r_2 - r_3)^2
.\]

For $f$ a quartic:
\[
\Delta_f 
&= (r_1 - r_2)^2(r_1 - r_3)^2 (r_1 - r_4)^2 \\
& \quad (r_2 - r_3)^2 (r_2 - r_4)^2 \\
& \quad (r_3 - r_4)^2
.\]

In general, for a degree $n$ polynomial this will have $n(n-1)/2$ terms.
:::

:::{.remark}
In general, 
\[
G \subseteq A_n \iff \sqrt{\Delta} \in k
,\]
i.e. $\Delta$ is a perfect square in the ground field $k$.

Some special cases of discriminant values:

- Quadratics: \[
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
\implies
\Delta = b^2-4ac
.\]
- Cubics:
  - General:
\[
f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \implies \Delta = b²c² - 4ac³ - 4b³d - 27a²d² + 18abc
.\]
    - Note that you can depress a general cubic by substituting $t=x - {b\over 3a}$, yielding
\[
f(t) = t³ + pt + q \implies \Delta = -4p³-27q²
.\]


:::

:::{.remark}
Some useful facts:

- $\Delta = 0 \iff f$ has a repeated root.
- $G\injects A_n \iff \Delta$ is a perfect square in $k$.

:::

## Worked Examples 

:::{.fact}
\envlist

:::

:::{.example title="Indirect: exactly one conjugate pair of roots"}
If $\deg f = 5$ with exactly 3 real roots and one non-real complex conjugate pair, then $G(f) = S_5$.
$G$ contains a transposition, namely complex conjugation on the conjugate pair.
This already implies $G\neq A_5$, since a transposition is an odd number of even cycles.

The claim is that $G$ contains an element of order 5, i.e. a 5-cycle, which is enough to generate $S_5$.
This follows because 

- Galois acts transitively, so there is a length 5 orbit.
- By Orbit-Stabilizer, 5 divides $\# G$.
- By Sylow, there is an element of order 5.

So $G = S_5$.
:::

### Quadratics

:::{.example title="Classifying quadratics"}
Every degree 2 extension $L/k$ is Galois, except possibly in characteristic 2: 

- If \( \alpha\in L \sm k\) then \( \min_{\alpha}(x) \in L[x] \) must split in $L[x]$, so $L$ is automatically a splitting field.
  - Why? \( \alpha\in L \implies \min_{\alpha}(x) = (x- \alpha)g(x) \) which forces \( \deg(g) = 1 \).
- If $\ch(k) \neq 2$, then $L$ is separable since
\[
\min_{ \alpha}(x)' = 2x + \cdots \not\equiv 0
,\] 
:::

:::{.remark}
One can complete the square for quadratics:
\[
f(x)=x^{2}+\alpha x+\beta=\left(x-\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)^{2}+\beta-\frac{\alpha^{2}}{4} \text { . }
.\]

Thus it suffices to consider quadratics of the form $x^2+a$.
:::

:::{.example title="Quadratics"}
\envlist

- $G(x^2-m) = C_2$ for $m$ not a perfect square.
  - $x^2-m = (x+\sqrt{m})(x-\sqrt{m})$, so the splitting field is $\QQ(\sqrt{m})$ of degree 2.
  - Since $G\leq S_2$ and has order 2, $G= S_2 \cong C_2$.
  - Concretely, take $m=2$, then $G = \ts{\id, \tau}$ where $\tau: \sqrt{2} \mapsto -\sqrt{2}$, and correspondingly $a+b\sqrt{2} \mapsto a-b\sqrt{2}$.

- $G((x^2-2)(x^2-3)) = C_2\cross C_2$.
  - Since $G$ must permute irreducible factors, labeling the roots $r_1, r_2 = \pm \sqrt{2}$ and $r_3, r_4 = \pm \sqrt{3}$, we have 
  \[
G \subseteq \gens{(1, 2), (3, 4)} = \ts{\id, (1,2), (3,4), (1,2)(3,4)} \cong C_2\cross C_2
  .\]
  - $\# G = 4$, taking the tower $\QQ(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3) / \QQ(\sqrt 2)/ \QQ$ and noting $\sqrt 3 \not\in \QQ(\sqrt 2)$ which makes each step degree 2.
  So this forces $G \cong C_2\cross C_2$.
:::

### Cubics


:::{.remark}
Tricks/reminders:

- Try the rational roots test to check irreducibility, since reducible implies there's a linear factor.
- Nice situation: one real and two complex roots.
  Try Calculus and MVT to reason about real roots.
  This immediately yields $S_3$.
- Otherwise, 3 real roots (or no easy way to check root types).
  Try discriminant classification: put in the form $t^3+pt+q$, potentially using $t=x-b/3a$, then $\Delta = -4p^3-27q^2$.
:::

:::{.remark title="Easy cycles in odd/prime degrees with basic Calculus"}
If $n \da \deg f$ is odd, then $f$ has at least one real root.
If $f$ has two non-real roots, then $G$ contains a transposition.
If $n$ is prime, then $G$ contains an $n\dash$cycle (by transitivity and Cauchy), forcing $G = S_n$.
:::

:::{.example title="Of using easy cycles to get $S_3$"}
Let $f(x) = x^3-2$.

Then $f'(x) = 3x^2$, so $f$ is monotone increasing.
By the MVT, checking $f(-2)<0$ and $f(2)>0$, $f$ has a single real root in $[-2, 2]$.
The other two must be a complex conjugate pair.

Alternatively, just factor the darn thing: $f(x) = (x-\omega)(x-\zeta_3\omega)(x-\zeta_3^2\omega)$ where $\omega \da 2^{1\over 3}$ and $\zeta_3^3=1$.

So $G(f)$ contains a transposition, and since $\deg f = 3$ is prime, $G$ contains a 3-cycle and $G(f) = S_3$.
:::

:::{.example title="Of using easy cycles to get $S_3$"}
Let $f(x) = x^3-4x+5$.

Then $f'(x) = 3x^2-4 = 0$ when $x = \pm \sqrt{4/3}$.
Checking $f''(x) = 6x$ yields a max at $-\sqrt{4/3}$ and a min at $\sqrt{4/3}$.
Checking 
\[
f(4/3) = (4/3)^3-4(4/3)+5 = (64/27)-(16/3)+5 = 55/27 > 0
,\]
so knowing the general shape of a cubic, there is exactly one real root, somewhere in $(-\infty ,-\sqrt{4/3})$.
So $G(f) = S_3$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Classification for cubics"}
Away from $\ch k = 2$, Galois groups of cubics are entirely determined by discriminants:

**There are only two possibilities**: $S_3$ or $A_3 \cong C_3$.

- Otherwise, $G\cong S_3$.

- $G(x^3+x+1) = S_3$:
  - Irreducible because it has no rational roots (by the rational roots test)
  - $f'(x) = 3x^2+1>0$ so $f$ increases everywhere and can only have one real root $r$, so $\QQ(r)/\QQ = \deg f = 3$.
  - The other roots are a non-real conjugate pair $w, \bar{w}$, so $\QQ(w, r)/\QQ(r) = \deg f(x)/(x-r) = 2$.
  - So $[\SF(f): \QQ] = 6$, and the only transitive subgroup of order 6 in $S_3$ is $S_3$ itself.

### Quartics


:::{.definition title="Resolvent of a quartic"}
If 
\[
f(x)=x^{4}+a_{3} x^{3}+a_{2} x^{2}+a_{1} x+a_{0}

then define the **resolvent** of $f$ by

Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the roots $r_i$:
\[
\left(x-\left(r_{1} r_{2}+r_{3} r_{4}\right)\right)\left(x-\left(r_{1} r_{3}+r_{2} r_{4}\right)\right)\left(x-\left(r_{1} r_{4}+r_{2} r_{3}\right)\right)

- $x^p - a$ factors as $\prod_{k=0}^{p-1} (x- \zeta_p^k \omega)$ where $\omega \da a^{1\over p}$, so this splits in $\QQ(\zeta_p, \omega)$ which has degree 
\[
\phi(p) \cdot \deg \min_\omega(x) = (p-1)p
.\]
  - This yields two cyclic subgroups $C_{p-1}, C_p$ where $C_p\normal G$, and thus some semidirect product $C_{p-1} \actson C_{p}$.
- $x^p+a$ factors as $\prod_{k=0}^{p-1}(x - \zeta_p^k \omega )$ for $\omega \da (-a)^{1\over p}$.

Also use that splitting fields over $\QQ$ are always normal, so it suffices to check that $f$ is separable and irreducible to show extensions are Galois.

:::{.example title="$x^n-a$"}
Degree 3:

- $G(x^3-2): S_3$
  - The roots are $\zeta_3^k \omega$ for $0\leq k \leq 3$, $\omega \da 2^{1\over 3}$.
  - The splitting field is $\QQ(\omega, \zeta_3)$ which has degree $3\phi(3) =6$.
  - The possibilities are $G = A_3\cong C_3, S_3$, and order 6 forces $G=S_3$. 
  - Useful alternative:
    - Note that there is exactly one real root and one conjugate pair, so $G$ contains a transposition $(23)$.
    - There is a 3-cycle $(123)$ given by fixing $\omega$ and sending $\zeta_3 \mapsto \zeta_3\omega$, and this is enough to generate $D_3 \cong S_3$.


Degree 4:

- $G(x^4-1) = C_2$:
  - The roots are $\zeta_4^k$ for $0\leq k \leq 3$.
  - The splitting field is $\QQ(\zeta_4) = \QQ(i)$ which has degree $\phi(4) = 2$.
  - But this is not a reducible polynomial!
    Use that that Galois is defined as $\Aut(\SF(f) / \QQ)$ and quadratic extensions are Galois.

- $G(x^4-2) = D_4$: 
  - The roots are $\zeta_4^k \omega$ for $0\leq k \leq 3$, where $\zeta_4 = i, \omega = 2^{1\over 4}$.
    - Explicitly, $r_i \in \ts{\omega, i\omega, -\omega, -i\omega}$
  - The splitting field is $\QQ(\omega, \zeta_4)$, which has degree $4\phi(4) = 8$ since $\min_{\zeta_4} = x^2+1$, which is still irreducible over $\QQ(\omega) \subseteq \RR$.
  - $D_4 \leq S_4$ is the only transitive subgroup of order 8.
  - Useful note on bounding the size:
    - Any $\sigma \in G$ must preserves roots of $x^4-2$ but also $x^2+1$.
      So there are at most 4 possibilities for $\sigma(\omega)$, and at most 2 for $\sigma(\zeta_4)$, so $\# G \leq 8$ and $G\neq S_4$.
  - Explicitly, there is a 4-cycle $\sigma = (1,2,3,4)$ generated by $\omega \mapsto \zeta_4 \omega$ and a 2-cycle $(2,4)$ given by complex conjugation, and this generates $D_4$ since $\gcd(4-2, 4) \neq 1$.
    - Why this is a 4-cycle: check $\sigma(i)=i$, and:
  \[
  \sigma(r_1) &= r_2 = ir_1 \\
  \sigma(r_2) &= \sigma(ir_1) = ir_2 = r_3 \\
  \sigma(r_3) &= \sigma(ir_2) = ir_3 = i(ir_2) = -r_2 = r_4
    .\]

- $G(x^p-1) = C_p\units$:
  - ?


:::

:::{.example title="$x^n+a$"}
\envlist

- $G(x^4+1) = C_2^2$:
  - This is irreducible because it is irreducible (by having no roots) mod $3$.
  - The roots are $\zeta_8^k$ for $k=1,3,5,7$ coprime to 8, since this is $\Phi_8(x)$.
  - The splitting field is $\QQ(\zeta_8) = \QQ(i, \sqrt 2)$, noting that $\zeta_8 = e^{2\pi i \over 8} = e^{\pi i \over 4} = \cos(\pi/4) + i\sin(\pi/4) = (1/2)(\sqrt 2 + i \sqrt{2})$ so we have containment and both are degree $\phi(8)=4$ extensions.
  - This restricts to $C_4, C_2^2$.
  - Reduce $\mod 5$ to get $(x^2+2)(x^2+2)$ of cycle type $(2, 2)$, forcing $C_2^2$.

- $G(x^4+2) = D_4$: 
  - The roots are $\zeta_8^k \omega$ for $\omega = 2^{1\over 4}, k = 1,3,5,7$ coprime to 8. 
  - The splitting field is $\QQ(\zeta_8, \omega) = \QQ(\zeta_4, \omega)$.


- $G(x^4+3) = D_4$:
  - The roots are $\zeta_8^k, \omega$ for $\omega = 3^{1\over 4}, k=1,3,5,7$ coprime to 8.
  - The splitting field is $\QQ(\omega, \zeta_8)$ of degree $\phi(8) = 8$

# Modules

## Definitions and Basics

:::{.definition title="$R\dash$modules"}
Four properties:

- $r(x+y) = rx + ry$
- $(r+s)x = rs + sx$
- $(rs)x= r(s(x))$
- $1_Rx = x$

Note that $M$ is additionally an $R\dash$algebra if the multiplication map is $R\dash$bilinear and so given by $m: M^{\tensor_R 2}\to M$ satisfying
\[
r. m(a\tensor b) = m(r.a \tensor b) = m(a\tensor r.b) && \forall r\in R, a,b \in M
.\]

:::


:::{.proposition title="The one-step submodule test"}
$N\subseteq M$ is an $R\dash$submodule iff $N$ is nonempty and for every $r\in R$ and $x, y \in N$, we have $rx+y\in N$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Module Morphisms"}
A map $f: M\to N$ is a **morphism of modules** iff $f(rm + n) = rf(m) + f(n)$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="One-step module morphism test"}
A map $\phi: M\to N$ is a morphism in $\rmod$ iff
\[
\phi(r.x + y) = r.\phi(x) + \phi(y) \in N && \forall r\in R, x,y\in M
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
Quotients of modules are easier to reason about additively, writing $M/N = \ts{x + N}$ as cosets.
Then $(x + N) + (y + N) = (x+y) + N$ and $(x+N)(y+N) = (xy) + N$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Simple modules"}
A module is **simple** iff it has no nontrivial proper submodules.
:::

:::{.definition title="Indecomposable modules"}
A module $M$ is **decomposable** iff it admits a direct sum decomposition $M \cong M_1 \oplus M_2$ with $M_1, M_2 \neq 0$.
An **indecomposable** module is defined in the obvious way.
:::

:::{.definition title="Cyclic modules"}
A module $M$ is **cyclic** if there exists a single generator $m\in M$ such that $M = mR \da \gens{ m }$.
:::

## Structure Theorems

:::{.proposition title="Isomorphism theorems"}
\[
M / \ker \phi &\cong \im \phi \\
{A+B \over B} &\cong {A\over A \intersect B} \\
{M/A \over B/A} &\cong {M\over B} \\
\correspond{
  \text{Submodules of } M \\ \text{containing }N
}
&\mapstofrom
\correspond{
  \text{Submodules of } M/N
}
\\
A &\mapstofrom A/N
.\]

Note that the lattice correspondence commutes with sums and intersections of submodules.

:::

:::{.proposition title="Recognizing direct sums"}
If $M_1, M_2 \leq M$ are submodules, then $M = M_1 \oplus M_2$ if the following conditions hold:

- $M_1 + M_2 = M$
- $M_1 \intersect M_2 = 0$
:::


## Exact Sequences

:::{.definition title="Exact Sequences"}
A sequence of \(R\dash\)module morphisms 
\[
0 \mapsvia{d_1} A \mapsvia{d_2} B \mapsvia{d_3} C \to 0
\]
is *exact* iff $\im d_i = \ker d_{i+1}$.
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that $C\cong B/d_1(A)$ always, but $B$ is not a direct sum of the outer terms unless the sequence splits.
:::


:::{.definition title="Split Exact Sequences"}
A short exact sequence 
\[
\xi: 0 \to A \mapsvia{d_1} B \mapsvia{d_2} C \to 0
\]
has a **right-splitting** iff there exists a map $s: C\to B$ such that $d_2 \circ s = \id_{C}$.
$\xi$ has a **left-splitting** iff there exists a map $t:B\to A$ such that $t \circ d_1 = \id_A$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Equivalent conditions for splitting SESs"}
Let $\xi: 0 \to A \mapsvia{d_1} B \mapsvia{d_2}  C \to 0$ be a SES, then TFAE

- $\xi$ admits a right-splitting $s: C\to B$.
- $C$ is projective.
- $\xi$ admits a left-splitting $t: B\to A$.
- $A$ is injective.
- $\xi$ is isomorphic to a SES of the form $0\to A \to A \oplus C \to C \to 0$.

:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Right-splitting implies direct sum:

- Use that $B \subset \ker d_2 + \im s$, writing $b = (b - sd_2(b) ) + sd_2(b)$ and noting
\[
d_2(b - sd_2(b)) = d_2(b) - d_2sd_2(b) = d_2(b) - d_2(b) = 0 
.\]
- Show $\ker d_2 \intersect \im s=0$, writing $b$ with $d_2(b) = 0$ and $b = s(c)$ for some $c$ yields
\[
0 = d_2(b) = d_2s(c) = \id_C(c) = c
.\]

## Free and Projective Modules

:::{.definition title="Free Module"}
A **free** module $M$ is a module satisfying any of the following conditions:

- A universal property:
  There is a set \( \mathcal{B}  \) and a set map \( M \mapsvia{\iota} \mathcal{B}  \) such that every set map \( \mathcal{B} \mapsvia{N} \) lifts:

\begin{tikzcd}

- Existence of a basis:

  There is linearly independent (so $\sum r_i \beta_i = 0 \implies r_i = 0$) spanning set (so \( m\in M \implies m = \sum r_i \beta_i \) ) of the form \( \mathcal{B} \da \ts{ \beta_i }_{i\in I} \), 

- Direct sum decomposition:

  $M$ decomposes as $M \cong \bigoplus_{i\in I} \beta_i R$, a sum of cyclic submodules.

:::

:::{.example title="A non-free module"}
$\ZZ/6$ is a $\ZZ\dash$module that is *not* free, since the element \( [3] \) is a torsion element, where \( 2[3] = [6] = [0] \).
This uses the fact that free modules over a PID are torsionfree.
:::

:::{.definition title="Free rank"}
If a module $M$ is free, the **free rank** of $M$ is the cardinality of any basis.
:::

:::{.proposition title="?"}
Every free \(R\dash\)module admits a basis (spanning $R\dash$linearly independent set).
:::

:::{.definition title="Torsion and torsionfree"}
An element $m\in M$ is a **torsion element** if there exists a nonzero $r\in R$ such that $rm = 0_M$.
A module \( M \) is **torsion-free** if and only if for every \( x\in M \), \( mx = 0_M \implies m=0_M \), i.e. $M$ has no nonzero torsion elements.
Equivalently, defining $M_t \da \ts{ m\in M \st \exists r\in R, rm = 0_M }$ as the set of all torsion elements, $M$ is torsion free iff $M_t = 0$.
If $M_t = M$, we say $M$ is a **torsion module**.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Free implies torsionfree"}
For $R$ an integral domain, any finitely generated free \(R\dash\)module $M$ is torsionfree.
:::

:::{.proof title="that free implies torsionfree"}
\envlist

- If $M$ is finitely generated, write $M = \gens{X}$ with $X\da \ts{x_1, \cdots, x_m}$ and $\# X<\infty$ a finite generating set.
- Since $M$ is free, there is some maximal subset of generators $\mcb \da \ts{x_1, \cdots, x_n} \subseteq X$ where $n\leq m$ that is linearly independent.
- Consider $N\leq M$ defined by $\gens{\mcb}$; this is a basis for $N$ and makes $N$ free.
  The claim is now that $M\cong N$, so that any maximal linearly independent subset of generators is all of $X$.
- If $N \not\cong M$, set $\mcb^c \da X\sm \mcb = \ts{x_{n+1}, \cdots, x_m}$ to be all generators for $M$ that the basis $\mcb$ misses.
- Then $\mcb^c \union \ts{x_{j}}$ for any $n+1\leq j \leq m$ has a linear dependence, and $r_j x_j + \sum_{k=1}^n r_n x_n = 0$ for some $r_j\neq 0$ implies $r_j x_j = - \sum_{k=1}^n r_n x_n$.
- Let $r$ be the product of all of the scalars obtained this way, so $r = \prod_{k=n+1}^m r_j$, and consider the submodule $rX \leq N \leq M$.
  We get $rM \leq N \leq M$ since $X$ is a generating set for $M$, so it now suffices to show $rM \cong M$.
- Just define a map $\phi_r: M\surjects rM$ where $m\mapsto rm$, and note $\ker \phi_r =\ts{ m\in M \st rm = 0} = 0$ since $M$ is torsionfree.
  So $M = M/\ker \phi_r \cong rM$.
:::

:::{.example title="A torsionfree module that is not free"}
$\QQ \in \mods{\ZZ}$ is torsionfree, but not free as a \(\ZZ\dash\)module.
This follows because any two elements $a/b, p/q$ are in a single ideal, since taking $d\da \gcd(b, q)$ we have $1/a = 1/d + \cdots 1/d$ and similarly $p/q = 1/a + \cdots + 1/a$, so these are in \( \gens{ 1/d }  \).
So any basis has size one, which would mean $\QQ = \ts{ \pm 1/d, \pm 2/d, \cdots }$ which in particular doesn't include the average of the first two terms.
:::

:::{.definition title="Projective Modules"}
A module $P$ is **projective** iff it satisfies any of the following conditions:

- A universal property: for every surjective $N \mapsvia{g} M$ and $P \mapsvia{f} M$, the following lift exists:

- Direct summand:

  $P$ is a direct summand of a free module $F$, so $F = P \oplus T$ for some module $T\leq F$.

- Splitting:

  For every SES $0\to A\to B\to P\to 0$, there is a right section $P\to B$ such that $P\to B\to P = \id_P$.

  > Note that this implies $B\cong \im(P\to B) \oplus \ker(B\to P)$.
  
- Exactness:

  The (always left-exact) covariant hom functor $\Hom(P, \wait)$ is right-exact.

:::{.proposition title="Principal Ideals are Free"}
If $I \normal R$ is an ideal of $R$, then $I$ is a free $R\dash$module iff $I$ is a principal ideal.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
$\implies$:

Suppose $I$ is free as an $R\dash$module, and let $B = \theset{\vector m_j}_{j\in J} \subseteq I$ be a basis so we can write $M = \generators{B}$.
Suppose that $\abs{B} \geq 2$, so we can pick at least 2 basis elements $\vector m_1\neq \vector m_2$, and consider
$$
\vector c = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_2 \vector m_1,
$$

which is also an element of $M$ .
Since $R$ is an integral domain, $R$ is commutative, and so
$$
\vector c = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_2 \vector m_1 = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_1 \vector m_2 = \vector 0_M
$$

However, this exhibits a linear dependence between $\vector m_1$ and $\vector m_2$, namely that there exist $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \neq 0_R$ such that $\alpha_1 \vector m_1 + \alpha_2 \vector m_2 = \vector 0_M$; this follows because $M \subset R$ means that we can take $\alpha_1 = -m_2, \alpha_2 = m_1$. This contradicts the assumption that $B$ was a basis, so we must have $\abs{B} = 1$ and so $B = \theset{\vector m}$ for some $\vector m \in I$. But then $M = \generators{B} = \generators{\vector m}$ is generated by a single element, so $M$ is principal.

$\impliedby$:
Suppose $M\normal R$ is principal, so $M = \generators{\vector m}$ for some $\vector m \neq \vector{0}_M \in M \subset R$.

Then $x\in M \implies x = \alpha\vector m$ for some element $\alpha\in R$ and we just need to show that $\alpha\vector m = \vector 0_M \implies \alpha = 0_R$ in order for $\theset{\vector m}$ to be a basis for $M$, making $M$ a free $R\dash$module.
But since $M \subset R$, we have $\alpha, m \in R$ and $\vector 0_M = 0_R$, and since $R$ is an integral domain, we have $\alpha m = 0_R \implies \alpha = 0_R$ or $m = 0_R$.
Since $m \neq 0_R$, this forces $\alpha = 0_R$, which allows $\theset{m}$ to be a linearly independent set and thus a basis for $M$ as an $R\dash$module.

:::


:::{.remark}
This says every module $M$ decomposes as $M \cong F_M \oplus M_t$ where $F_M$ is free (and thus torsionfree) and $M_t$ is torsion, and moreover $F_M \cong M/M_t$.

That $M/M_t$ is torsionfree: suppose $r(m+ M_t) = M_t$, so $rm\in M_t$ is torsion.
Then $r'(rm)=0$ for some $r'$, making $m$ torsion, and $m+ M_t = M_t$ is the zero coset.

That $F_M \cong M/M_t$: take the SES $0\to M_t\to M \to F\to 0$ to get $F\cong M/M_t$.
This splits since $F$ is free and thus projective, so $F\cong M \oplus M_t$.

- $A^t$ is the usual transpose.
- $A^{\dagger}$ is the conjugate transpose.
- A matrix is $A^{\dagger}$ is **adjoint** to $A$ iff $\inner{A\vector x}{\vector y} = \inner{\vector x}{A^{\dagger} \vector y}$.

:::{.fact title="Undergrad reminders"}
\[
\det M = \prod_{\sigma \in S_n} \eps(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \sigma(i)}
.\]

For example,

\[
\operatorname{det}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{array}\right)=\begin{gathered}
a_{11} a_{22} a_{33}+a_{12} a_{23} a_{31}+a_{13} a_{21} a_{32} \\
-a_{13} a_{22} a_{31}-a_{12} a_{21} a_{33}-a_{11} a_{23} a_{32}
\end{gathered}
.\]

Let $\minor_A(i, j)$ denote $A$ with the $i$th row, $j$th column deleted.

One can expand determinants along rows:
\[
\det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} \det \minor_A(i, j)
.\]


Also useful, a matrix can be inverted by computing the adjugate:
\[
A\inv = {1\over \det A} \operatorname{adj}(A) && \adj(A)_{ij} \da (-1)^{i+j} \det \minor_A(j, i)
.\]

The eigenvalues of an upper-triangular matrix are exactly the diagonal entries, and the determinant is their product.
More generally, the determinant is always the product of the eigenvalues, and the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, so $\tr(A) = \sum \lambda_i$ and $\det(A) = \prod \lambda_i$.

Matrices can be block-multiplied when all dimensions are compatible:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
A & B \\
C & D 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
E & F \\
G & H 
\end{bmatrix}
= \matt{AE + BG}{AF + BH}{CE + DG}{ CF + DH}
.\]

> Note that if any of these matrix multiplications don't make sense, the results won't be valid!

If $A$ is upper triangular, some entries of $A^k$ can be computed easily:

\[
A\da\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_1 & & * \\
& \ddots & \\
0 & & a_n
\end{array}\right)
\implies
A^k = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_1^k & & * \\
& \ddots & \\
0 & & a_n^k
\end{array}\right)
.\]


Traces of products can be commuted: $\trace(AB) = \trace(BA)$, so similar matrices have identical traces since $\trace(PJP\inv) = \trace{PP\inv J} = \trace{J}$.

The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are elementary symmetric functions in the eigenvalues:
\[
\chi_A(t) = t^n - \qty{\sum_i \lambda_i }t^{n-1} + \qty{\sum_{i < j} \lambda_i \lambda_j }t^{n-2} + \cdots \pm \qty{\prod_i \lambda_i}
.\]

## Definitions

:::{.remark}
The main powerhouse: for $T:V\to V$ a linear transformation for $V\in\Vect_k$, map to $V\in \modsleft{k[x]}$ by letting polynomials act via $p(x)\cdot \vector v \da p(T)(\vector v)$.
Using that $k[x]$ is a PID iff $k$ is a field, and we can apply the FTFGMPID to get two decompositions:
\[
V &\cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^n k[x]/ \gens{ q_i(x) } && q_{i}(x) \divides q_{i+1}(x) \divides \cdots  \\
V &\cong \bigoplus _{j=1}^m k[x] / \gens{ p_i(x)^{e_i} } && \text{ with } p_i \text{ not necessarily distinct.} 
\]

- The $q_i$ are the **invariant factors** of $T$
  - $q_i$ is the minimal polynomial of $T$ restricted to $V_i \da k[x] / \gens{ q_i(x) }$. 
  - The largest invariant factor $q_n$ is the **minimal polynomial** of $T$.
  - The product $\prod_{i=1}^n q_i(x)$ is the **characteristic polynomial** of $T$.
- The $p_i$ are the **elementary divisors** of $T$.

## Minimal / Characteristic Polynomials

:::{.proposition title="Useful computational trick"}
A trick for finding characteristic polynomials:
\[
\chi_A(t) &= \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \trace\qty{\Extpower^k A} t^{n-k} \\
&= t^n - \trace\qty{A} t^{n-1} + \trace\qty{\Extpower^2 A}t^{n-2} - \cdots \pm \trace\qty{\Extpower^{n-1} A} t \mp \det(A)
,\]
using that 

\[
{\Extpower^0 A} \da 1 \\
{\Extpower^1 A} \da A \\
\trace\qty{\Extpower^n A} = \det(A)
.\]

Moreover, the intermediate traces are easy to compute by hand:
\[
\trace\qty{\Extpower^\ell A} = \sum \det\qty{M^{\ell}}
,\]
where the sum is taken over all $\ell\times\ell$ **principal minors**: determinants of the $n \choose \ell$ principal matrices which are obtained by choosing $\ell$ diagonal entries to keep and and deleting the rows and columns for every entry not chosen.
Equivalently, one can select $n-\ell$ diagonal entries and delete the corresponding row/column for each.

To factor this polynomial, the **rational roots test** can be useful: for $f(t) = a_nt^n + \cdots + a_1 t + a_0$, rational roots are of the form $p/q$ where $p \divides a_n$ and $q\divides a_0$.
Note that this simplifies greatly for $f$ monic!
Once you have a root, apply **polynomial long division** to get a smaller problem, and hopefully this continues to work until it's factored.

Let $m(x)$ denote the minimal polynomial $A$.

1. Find the characteristic polynomial $\chi(x)$; this annihilates $A$ by Cayley-Hamilton. Then $m(x) \divides \chi(x)$, so just test the finitely many products of irreducible factors.

2. Pick any $\vector v$ and compute $T\vector v, T^2\vector v, \cdots T^k\vector v$ until a linear dependence is introduced. Write this as $p(T) = 0$; then $\min_A(x) \divides p(x)$.

:::

:::{.proposition title="Minimal equals characteristic iff cyclic"}
$\chi_A(x) = \min_A(x)$ iff $A$ admits a cyclic vector.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
$\not\implies$:
In general, $\min_A \divides \chi_A$, so suppose they're not equal.
Set $n\da \deg \chi_A$, then if $n' \da \deg \min_A < n$, using that $\min_A(A) = 0$ this exhibits a linear dependence in $\ts{v, Av, \cdots, A^{n'} v}$ for any $v$.
In particular, since $n>n'$, any set $\ts{v, Av,\cdots,A^nv}$ has a linear dependence.

$\implies$:
Apply the structure theorem to write $V\cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^m k[x]/\gens{p_i}$.
Since $\chi_A(x) = \prod p_i(x)$ and $\min_A(x) = p_m(x)$, this forces $m=1$ -- one way to see this is that $\dim_k V = \sum_{i=1}^m \dim_k k[x]/\gens{p_i}$,
where $\deg \chi_A = \dim_k V$ and $\deg \min_A = \dim k[x]/\gens{p_m}$.
For these to be equal, this forces $\dim_k k[x]/\gens{p_i} = 0$ for $1\leq i \leq m-1$, making $V$ a cyclic $k[x]\dash$module.
So $V = k[x]\actson \vector v$ for some $\vector v\in V$, which is the desired cyclic vector, and 
\[
V = \ts{f(x).v \st f\in k[x]} = \spanof_k\ts{A^k v \st k\geq 0}
.\]
By Cayley-Hamilton, $\chi_A(A) = 0$ and so $A^n$ is a linear combinations of $A^k$ for $0\leq k \leq n-1$, so $V= \spanof_k \ts{A^k v \st 0\leq k \leq n-1}$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Rational Canonical Form"}
$\RCF(A)$ is a block matrix where each block is the companion matrix of an invariant factor of $A$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Thus the blocks of $\RCF(A)$ biject with invariant factors of $A$.
Note that any companion matrix is already in $\RCF$.
:::

:::{.proof title="Derivation of RCF"}
\envlist

- Let $k[x] \actson V$ by $p(x) \actson \vector v \da p(T)(\vector v)$, making $V$ into a finitely generated torsion $k[x]\dash$module. 
  - Note that $k[x]\dash$submodules are exactly $T\dash$invariant subspaces.

- $k$ a field implies $k[x]$ a PID, so apply structure theorem to obtain an invariant factor decomposition 
\[
V \cong k[x] / \gens{\chi_T(x)} \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^m k[x] / \gens{ p_i(x) }
&& p_1(x) \divides p_2(x) \divides \cdots p_m(x)
.\]
  
- Since each factor is submodule, each corresponds to a $T\dash$invariant subspace $V_i$ where $p_i$ is the minimal polynomial of $T$ restricted to $V_i$.

  - The largest invariant factor $p_m$ is the minimal polynomial of $T$, their product is the characteristic polynomial.
  This follows because $p_m(x)\actson V = 0$, since $p_i\divides p_m$ for all $i$, forcing $\min_A \divides p_m$ by minimality.

- Write $V \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^m V_i$ as a $k[x]\dash$module, where $V_i \da k[x] / \gens{ p_i(x) }$, then $T$ is a block matrix $\bigoplus_{i=1}^m T_i$ where $T_i$ is the restriction of $T$ to $V_i$:
\[
\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}T_{1} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & T_{2} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots \\ 0 & \cdots & & & T_{n}\end{array}\right)
.\]

- It suffices to determine the form of a single $M_i$, so without loss of generality suppose $m=1$ so $V = V_1 = k[x] / \gens{ p(x) }$ is a cyclic $k[x]\dash$module with $\deg p(x) = n$.

- $\chi_M(x) = \min_M(x) \iff$ there exists a cyclic vector $\vector v$, so the set \( \ts{\vector v_i}_{i=0}^{n-1} \da \ts{ \vector v, T\vector v, T^2\vector v, \cdots, T^{n-1}\vector v } \) is a basis for $V_1$.
  - If there is any linear independence, this gives a polynomial relation $\sum_{i=1}^{n'} a_iT^i\vector v = 0$ for some $n'<n$, but then $q(x) \da \sum_{i=1}^{n'} a_i x^i$ is a polynomial annihilating $T$, contradicting the minimality of $p(x)$.
  - So this yields $n$ linearly independent vectors in $k^n$, so it's a basis.
- What is $M_i$ in this basis?
  Check where basis elements are mapped to by $T$, noting that 
  \[
p(T) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i T^i\vector v = T^n + a_{n-1} T^{n-1}\vector v + a_{n-2} T^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1 T\vector v + a_0 \vector v = 0
  ,\]
  using the minimal polynomial we can write
  - $T\vector v_0 = \vector v_1$
  - $T\vector v_2 = T^2 \vector v_0$
  - $T\vector v_3 = T^3 \vector v_0$

  - $T\vector v_{n-2} = T^{n-1}\vector v$
  - $T\vector v_{n-1} = T^n\vector v = -a_{n-1}T^{n-1}\vector v - \cdots - a_1 T\vector v - a_0 \vector v$ 

- So we have

### Smith Normal Form

:::{.fact}
For $A\in \Mat(m\times n; R)$ over $R$ any PID, $\SNF(A)$ is a matrix whose diagonal entries are the invariant factors.
How to compute $\SNF(A)$: take $A = \diag(a_i)$ where $a_i = d_i/d_{i-1}$ and $d_i$ is the $\gcd$ of the determinants of all $i\times i$ minors of $A$.
$A\sim B$ are similar $\iff \SNF(A) = \SNF(B)$.

### Using Canonical Forms

$$
\chi_A(x) = \prod_{j=1}^n f_j(x)
.$$
:::

:::{.lemma title="?"}
The minimal polynomial of $A$ is the *invariant factor of highest degree*, i.e.

\min_A(x) = f_n(x)
.$$
:::

For a linear operator on a vector space of nonzero finite dimension, TFAE:

- The minimal polynomial is equal to the characteristic polynomial.

- The list of invariant factors has length one.

- The Rational Canonical Form has a single block.

- The operator has a matrix similar to a companion matrix.

- There exists a *cyclic vector* $\vector v$ such that $\spanof_k\theset{T^j \vector v \suchthat j = 1, 2, \cdots} = V.$

- $T$ has $\dim V$ distinct eigenvalues

## Diagonalizability

:::{.remark}
*Notation:*
$A^{\dagger}$ denotes the conjugate transpose of $A$.

:::

:::{.lemma title="?"}
Let $V$ be a vector space over $k$ an algebraically closed and $A \in \mathrm{End}(V)$.
Then if $W \subseteq V$ is an invariant subspace, so $A(W) \subseteq W$, the $A$ has an eigenvector in $W$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="The Spectral Theorem"}
\envlist

1. Hermitian (self-adjoint) matrices (i.e. $A^{\dagger} = A$) are diagonalizable over $\CC$.
2. Symmetric matrices (i.e. $A^t = A$) are diagonalizable over $\RR$.

:::

:::{.remark}
In fact, $A$ is symmetric $\iff \spec A$ forms an orthonormal basis.
:::

:::{.proof title="of spectral theorem"}
\envlist

- Suppose $A$ is Hermitian.
- Since $V$ itself is an invariant subspace, $A$ has an eigenvector $\vector v_1 \in V$.
- Let $W_1 = \spanof_k\theset{\vector v_1}\perp$.
- Then for any $\vector w_1 \in W_1$, 
$$
\inner{\vector v_1}{ A \vector w_1} =
\inner{A \vector v_1}{\vector w_1} =
\lambda \inner{\vector v_1}{\vector w_1} = 0,
$$
so $A(W_1) \subseteq W_1$ is an invariant subspace, etc.

- Suppose now that $A$ is symmetric.
- Then there is an eigenvector of norm 1, $\vector v \in V$.
\[
\lambda = \lambda\inner{\vector v}{\vector v} = \inner{A\vector v}{\vector v} = \inner{\vector v}{A\vector v} = \overline{\lambda} \implies \lambda \in \RR
.\]

:::{.proposition title="Simultaneous Diagonalizability"}
A set of operators $\theset{A_i}$ pairwise commute $\iff$ they are all simultaneously diagonalizable.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
By induction on number of operators

- $A_n$ is diagonalizable, so $V = \bigoplus E_i$ a sum of eigenspaces
- Restrict all $n-1$ operators $A$ to $E_n$.
- The commute in $V$ so they commute in $E_n$
- **(Lemma)** They were diagonalizable in $V$, so they're diagonalizable in $E_n$
- So they're simultaneously diagonalizable by I.H.
- But these eigenvectors for the $A_i$ are all in $E_n$, so they're eigenvectors for $A_n$ too.
- Can do this for each eigenspace.

$M$ is diagonalizable over $\FF \iff \min_M(x, \FF)$ splits into distinct linear factors over $\FF$, or equivalently iff all of the roots of $\min_M$ lie in $\FF$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
$\implies$:
If $\min_A$ factors into linear factors, so does each invariant factor, so every elementary divisor is linear and $JCF(A)$ is diagonal.

$\impliedby$:
If $A$ is diagonalizable, every elementary divisor is linear, so every invariant factor factors into linear pieces. 
But the minimal polynomial is just the largest invariant factor.

- Choose $\vector v_1$: there are $p$ choices for each coefficient, but leave out the vector $0$, so $p^n-1$ choices.
- Choose any $\vector v_2 \neq \lambda \vector v_1$, so $p^n-p$ choices.
- Choose any nonzero $\vector v_3 \neq \lambda \vector v_1 + \eta \vector v_2$, so $p^n-p^2$ choices.

  This forces $\JCF(A)$ to be strictly upper-triangular.

## Facts

:::{.fact}
The JCF corresponds to **elementary divisors**.
:::

\todo[inline]{Make more precise..}

:::{.proposition title="JCF Algorithm for generalized eigenvectors"}
The following algorithm always works for computing $\JCF(A)$:

- Compute and factor the characteristic polynomial as $\chi_A(x) = \prod_{i} (x-\lambda_i)^{m_i}$.
- For each $\lambda_i$, find the constant $\ell_i$ such that
\[
\cdots 
\rank (A-\lambda_i I)^{\ell_i - 1} 
> \rank (A-\lambda_i I)^{\ell_i}
{\color{red} = }
\rank (A-\lambda_i I)^{\ell_i+1}
{\color{red} = }
\rank (A-\lambda_i I)^{\ell_i+1}
{\color{red} = } \cdots
.\]
- Find as many usual eigenvectors $\vector v_i$ as you can.
   The number of eigenvectors you find will be $\dim E_{\lambda_i}$.
  Suppose you just get one, $\vector v$.
- Solve the systems:
\[
(A - \lambda_i I)\vector v_1 = \vector v &\implies \vector v_1 = ? \\
(A - \lambda_i I)^2\vector v_2 = \vector v_1 &\implies \vector v_2 = ? \\
&\vdots \\
,\]
  which can be solved by putting the $\vector v_i$ in an augmented matrix and computing the RREF.
- This terminates in at most $\ell_i$ steps, and these vectors correspond to a single Jordan block.
- If there are other eigenvectors $\vector w, \cdots$ for $\lambda_i$, repeating this process yields a Jordan block for each of them.
  Assemble $P$ by placing these $\vector v_i$ in the appropriate columns.
:::

:::{.lemma title="JCF from Minimal and Characteristic Polynomials"}
Writing $\spec(A) = \theset{(\lambda_i, m_i)}$,
\[
\min_A(x) &= \prod_i (x- \lambda_i)^{\ell_i} \\
\chi_A(x) &= \prod (x- \lambda_i)^{m_i} \\
E_{\lambda_i} &= \dim(A - \lambda_i I)
\]

- The roots both polynomials are precisely the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $A$.
  - $m_i$ are the *algebraic multiplicities*.
  - $\dim E_{\lambda_i}$ are the *geometric multiplicities*.

- $\ell_i \leq m_i$ by Cayley-Hamilton.

- $\ell_i$ is
  - The size of the **largest** Jordan block associated to $\lambda_i$[^why_largest_block], and 
  - The "stabilizing constant".

- $m_i$, associated to the characteristic polynomial, is
  - The **sum of sizes** of all Jordan blocks associated to $\lambda_i$, 
  - The number of times $\lambda_i$ appears on the diagonal of $JCF(A)$, 
  - The dimension of the *generalized* eigenspace $V^{\lambda_i}$.

- $\dim E_{\lambda_i}$ is 
  - The **number of Jordan blocks** associated to $\lambda_i$
  - The number of (usual) eigenvector associated to $\lambda_i$, i.e. the dimension of their span.

- $A$ is diagonalizable iff $\dim E_{\lambda_i} = m_i$ for all $i$.

[^why_largest_block]: 
This is because $(x-\lambda_i)^{\ell_i}$ annihilates a Jordan block of size $\ell_i$, along with any blocks of size $k\leq \ell_i$.

:::


:::{.example title="?"}
Suppose $A$ is $5\times 5$ with 
\[
\min_A(t) &= (t-4)^2(t+6) \\
\chi_A(t) &= (t-4)^3(t+6)^2
.\]

Some deductions:

- For $\lambda = 4$:
  - The total size of all blocks is 3
  - The largest block is size 2
  - So this yields $J_1 \oplus J_2$.
- For $\lambda = -6$:
  - The total size of all blocks is 2
  - The largest block is size 1
  - So this must be $J_1 \oplus J_1$

:::


:::{.warnings}
The data of $\min_A(t), \chi_A(t)$ is **not** enough to uniquely determine $\JCF(A)$.
Counterexample: there are two distinct possibilities for $4\times 4$ matrices with $\min_A(t) = t^2$ and $\chi_A(t) = t^4$, namely $J_2 \oplus J_2$ and $J_2 \oplus J_1 \oplus J_1$.
:::



:::{.lemma title="?"}
The elementary divisors of $A$ are the minimal polynomials of the Jordan blocks.
:::

:::{.remark}
Writing $\Ann(\vector v)$ as the annihilator of $\vector v$, a generalized eigenvector for the pair $(\lambda_i, \vector v)$ for a matrix $A$ is any operator in the space $\sqrt{\Ann(\vector v)}$, where we view $V$ as a $k[x]\dash$module using $p(x) \actson \vector v \da p(A)(\vector v)$.
So 
\[
\Ann(\vector v) \da \ts{ q(x) \in k[x] \st q(x) \actson \vector v = 0} = \ts{q(x) \in k[x] \st q(A)(\vector v) = 0}
.\]
Now use that $\vector w$ is an eigenvector for $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda_i \iff A-\lambda_i I \in \Ann(\vector w)$, and is a generalized eigenvector iff
\[
(A-\lambda_i I)^k\in \Ann(\vector w) &\text{ for some }k \iff A-\lambda_i I \in \sqrt{\Ann(\vector w)}
.\]

We can then write
\[
V^{\lambda_i} 
&\da \ts{\vector v\in V \st (A-\lambda_i I)^n \vector v = 0 \text{ for some }n } \\
&= \ts{\vector v\in V \st (A-\lambda_i I)^n \in \Ann(\vector v) } \\
&= \ts{\vector v\in V \st A-\lambda_i I \in \sqrt{\Ann(\vector v)} } 
,\]
and the theorem is that $V \cong \bigoplus_i V^{\lambda_i}$.
It also turns out that $V^{\lambda_i} = \ker (A-\lambda_i I)^n$ for $n\da \dim V$.
:::

:::{.proof title="of generalized eigenspace decomposition"}

- Suppose $\chi_A(x) = \prod (x-\lambda_i)^{n_i}$.
- Define $V^{j} \da \ker (A-\lambda_i I)^n$ as the generalized eigenspace for each $i$.
- Fix $j$ and define $h_j(x) = \prod_{i\neq j}(x-\lambda_i)^{n_i}$, the characteristic polynomial with the $\lambda_j$ term deleted.
- Define $W^j \da \im(h_j(A))$, then the claim is $W^j \subseteq V^j$
  - This follows because $0 = \chi_A(A) = (A-\lambda_j I)^{n_j} h_j(A)$, so in fact $W^j \subseteq \ker (A - \lambda_j)^{n_j}$.
- Claim: $\sum V^j = V$:
  - Let $\vector v\in V$ be arbitrary, then by Euclid's algorithm write $\sum_i f_i h_i = 1$ since the $h_i$ are coprime.
  - Thus $\sum f_i(A) h_i(A) = I \implies \qty{\sum f_i(A) h_i(A)}(\vector v) = \vector v \implies \vector v \in \sum W^j$
- Claim: the sum is direct.
  - It suffices to show $0=\sum w_i$ with $w_i \in W^i$ implies $w_i =0$ for all $i$.
  - Use that $h_j(w_i) = 0$ for $i\neq j$ since $w_i \in W^i \da \ker(A-\lambda_I I)^{n_i}$.
  - Write $\vector w_i = \sum f_j(A) h_j(A) \vector w_i$, which collapses to $f_i(A) h_i(A) \vector w_i$.
  - So $f_i(A) h_i(A) \qty{\sum w_i} = 0 \implies w_i = 0$.

## Ring Theory

### Basic Structure

- Show that if an ideal $I\normal R$ contains a unit then $I = R$.
- Show that $R\units$ need not be closed under addition.

### Ideals

- $\star$ Show that if $x$ is not a unit, then $x$ is contained in some maximal ideal.

:::{.problem title="Units or Zero Divisors"}
Every $a\in R$ for a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor.
:::

:::{.solution}
\hfill
- Let $a\in R$ and define $\phi(x) = ax$.
- If $\phi$ is injective, then it is surjective, so $1 = ax$ for some $x \implies x\inv = a$.
- Otherwise, $ax_1 = ax_2$ with $x_1 \neq x_2 \implies a(x_1 - x_2) = 0$ and $x_1 - x_2 \neq 0$
- So $a$ is a zero divisor.
:::

:::{.problem title="Maximal implies prime"}
Maximal $\implies$ prime, but generally not the converse.
:::

:::{.solution}

- Suppose $\mm$ is maximal, $ab\in \mm$, and $b\not\in \mm$.

- Then there is a containment of ideals $\mm \subsetneq \mm + (b) \implies \mm + (b) = R$.

- So
\[
1 = m + rb \implies a = am + r(ab)
,\]
  but $am\in \mm$ and $ab\in \mm \implies a\in \mm$.


*Counterexample*: 
$(0) \in \ZZ$ is prime since $\ZZ$ is a domain, but not maximal since it is properly contained in any other ideal.
:::

- Show that every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal
- Show that if $x\in R$ a PID, then $x$ is irreducible $\iff \gens{x}\normal R$ is maximal.
- Show that intersections, products, and sums of ideals are ideals.
- Show that the union of two ideals need not be an ideal.
- Show that every ring has a proper maximal ideal.
- Show that $I\normal R$ is maximal iff $R/I$ is a field.
- Show that $I \normal R$ is prime iff $R/I$ is an integral domain.
- Show that $\union_{\mfm \in \maxspec(R)} = R\setminus R\units$.
- Show that $\maxspec(R) \subsetneq \spec(R)$ but the containment is strict.
- Show that every prime ideal is radical.
- Show that the nilradical is given by $\nilrad{R} = \rad(0)$.
- Show that $\text{rad}(IJ) = \text{rad}(I) \intersect \text{rad}(J)$
- Show that if $\spec(R) \subseteq \maxspec(R)$ then $R$ is a UFD.
- Show that if $R$ is Noetherian then every ideal is finitely generated.

### Characterizing Certain Ideals

- Show that for an ideal $I\normal R$, its radical is the intersection of all prime ideals containing $I$.
- Show that $\rad{I}$ is the intersection of all prime ideals containing $I$.

:::{.problem title="Jacobson radical is bigger than the nilradical"}
The nilradical is contained in the Jacobson radical, i.e.
\[
\nilrad{R} \subseteq J(R)
.\]
:::

:::{.solution}
Maximal $\implies$ prime, and so if $x$ is in every prime ideal, it is necessarily in every maximal ideal as well.
:::

:::{.problem title="Mod by nilradical to kill nilpotents"}
$R/ \nilrad{R}$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist
\[
a + \nilrad{R} \text{ nilpotent } &\implies (a+ \nilrad{R})^n \definedas a^n + \nilrad{R}= \nilrad{R} \\
&\implies a^n \in \nilrad{R} \\
&\implies \exists \ell \text{ such that } (a^n)^\ell = 0 \\
&\implies a\in \nilrad{R}
.
\]
:::

:::{.problem title="Nilradical is intersection of primes"}
The nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals, i.e.
\[
\nilrad{R} = \Intersect_{\mathfrak{p} \in \spec(R)} \mathfrak{p}
\]
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- $\nilrad{R} \subseteq \intersect \mathfrak{p}$:

- $x \in \nilrad{R} \implies x^n = 0 \in \mathfrak p \implies x\in \mathfrak{p} \text{ or } x^{n-1}\in\mathfrak p$.

- $R\sm \nilrad{R} \subseteq \union_{\mfp} (R\sm \mathfrak{p})$:

- Define $S = \theset{I\normal R \suchthat a^n\not\in I \text{ for any } n}$.

- Then apply Zorn's lemma to get a maximal ideal $\mm$, and maximal $\implies$ prime.
:::

### Misc

- Show that localizing a ring at a prime ideal produces a local ring.
- Show that $R$ is a local ring iff for every $x\in R$, either $x$ or $1-x$ is a unit.
- Show that if $R$ is a local ring then $R\setminus R\units$ is a proper ideal that is contained in the Jacobson radical $J(R)$.
- Show that if $R\neq 0$ is a ring in which every non-unit is nilpotent then $R$ is local.

A subgroup $H\leq G$ is **characteristic** in $G$, written $H \ch G$, iff for every $\phi \in \Aut(G)$, $\phi(H) \leq H$.
Equivalently, $\phi(H) = H$.
I.e. $H$ is fixed (not necessarily pointwise) under every automorphism of the ambient group $G$.

Characteristic subgroups are normal, because $\psi_g(\wait) \da g(\wait)g\inv$ is an (inner) automorphic of $G$.

Characteristic subgroups of normal subgroups are normal, i.e. if $H\normal G$ and $N \ch H$, then $N\normal G$.

$A \ch B \normal C \implies A\normal C$:

- $A\ch B$ iff $A$ is fixed by every $\psi\in \Aut(B)$., WTS $cAc\inv = A$ for all $c\in C$.
- Since $B\normal C$, the automorphism $\psi(\wait) \da c(\wait)c\inv$ descends to an element of $\Aut(B)$.
- Then $\psi(A) = A$ since $A\ch B$, so $cAc\inv = A$ and $A\normal C$.

&= \psi( g ) \psi( \psi \inv (h)) \\
&= \psi( \psi\inv(h) g) \\
&= (\psi\psi\inv)(h) \psi(g) \\
&= h\psi(g)
.\]
This yields $\psi(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G)$.
Applying the same argument to $\psi\inv$ yields $\psi\inv(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G)$.
Since $\psi$ is a bijection, $\psi\psi\inv(A) = A$ for all $A\leq G$, 
so $Z(G) \subseteq \psi(Z(G))$.

Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime number. Let
$X_p$ be the set of Sylow-$p$ subgroups of $G$ and $n_p$ be the
cardinality of $X_p$. Let $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ be the permutation group on
the set $X_p$.

1.  Construct a homomorphism $\rho: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X_p)$ with image
    a transitive subgroup (i.e. with a single orbit).

2.  Deduce that if $G$ is simple then the order of $G$ divides $n_p!$.

3.  Show that for any $1\leq a \leq 4$ and any prime power $p^k$, no
    group of order $ap^k$ is simple.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

1.  Define the required group action by $$\begin{aligned}
            \rho: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \\
            g \mapsto (\gamma_g: P \mapsto gPg^{-1}).
        \end{aligned}$$ The claim is that this action is transitive on
    $X_p$. This can be equivalently stated as
    $$\forall P \in X_p, \exists g \in G, P' \in X_p \mid gP'g^{-1} = P.$$

    However, by Sylow 2, all Sylow $p-$subgroups are conjugate to each
    other, and thus this condition is satisfied.

2.  Suppose that $G$ is simple, so that we have
    $$H \trianglelefteq G \implies H = \{ e \} \text{ or } H = G.$$

    Note that $\mathrm{Sym}(X_p) = (n_p)!$, and if we have an injective
    homomorphism $G \xrightarrow{\phi} \mathrm{Sym}(X_p)$, then
    $|G| = |\phi(G)|$, since $\phi(G) \leq \mathrm{Sym}(X_p)$ will be a
    subgroup and thus have order dividing $(n_p)!$, which proves the
    statement.

    Using the $\phi$ defined in (1), we can apply the first isomorphism
    theorem
    $$G / \ker \phi \cong \mathrm{im} \phi \leq \mathrm{Sym}(X_p),$$ and
    so it suffices to show that $\ker \phi = \{e\}$.

    Note that since $\ker \phi \trianglelefteq G$ and $G$ is simple, we
    can only have $\ker \phi = \{e\}$ or $\ker \phi = G$.

    Towards a contradiction, suppose $\ker \phi = G$.

    By definition, we have $$\begin{aligned}
        \ker \phi &= \{ g\in G \mid \gamma_g = \mathrm{id}_{X_p} \} \\
        &= \{ g\in G \mid \forall P \in X_p,~ gPg^{-1} = P \} \\
        &= \bigcap_{P \in X_p} N_G(P),
        \end{aligned}$$

    and so the kernel of $\varphi$ is the intersection of all of the
    normalizers of the Sylow $p-$subgroups.

    But this means that $N_G(P) = G$ for every Sylow $p-$subgroup, which
    means that $n_p = 1$ and there is a unique $P$ which must be normal
    in $G$. Since $G$ is simple, this forces $P$ to be trivial or the
    whole group.

    Towards a contradiction, suppose $P = G$. Then $G$ is a $p-$group
    and thus has order $p^n$. But then $G$ has normal subgroups of order
    $p^k$ for all $0 < k < n$, contradicting the simplicity of $G$.

    But the only other option is that $P$ is trivial, whereas we know
    nontrivial Sylow $p-$subgroups exist by Sylow 1.

    Thus we can not have $\ker \phi = G$, and so $\ker \phi$ is trivial
    as desired.

3.  Suppose $\left| G \right| = ap^k$, where $1 \leq a \leq 4$. Then by
    Sylow 3, we have $n_p = 1 \mod p$ and $n_p$ divides $a$. If $a=1$,
    then $n_p = 1$, and so $G$ can not be simple. Moreover, if
    $p \geq a$, then $n_p \leq a$ and $n_p = 1\mod p$ forces $n_p = 1$
    again.

    So we can restrict our attention to $2 \leq a \leq 4$ and
    $p = 2, 3$, which reduces to checking the cases
    $ap^k = 2 (3^k), 4 (3^k)$, or $3 (2^k)$ for $k\geq 1$.

    If $ap^k = 2(3^k)$, we have $n_3 = 1 \mod 3$ and $n_3 \divides 2$,
    which forces $n_3 = 1$, so this can not be a simple group.

    Similarly, if $ap^k = 4(3^k)$, then $n_3 = 1 \mod 3$ and $n_3$
    divides 4, which forces $n_3 = 1$ and thus $G$ can't be simple.

    If $ap^k = 3(2^k)$, then $n_2 = 1 \mod 2$ and $n_2$ divides 3, so
    $n_2 = 1, 3$. But then $n_3! = 6$, and if $k > 1$, we have
    $3(2^k) > 6 = n_3!$, so $G$ can not be simple by the result in (2).

    If $k = 1$, then $G$ is order 6, so $G$ is isomorphic to either
    $\ZZ_6$ or $S_3$. The group $S_3$ is not simple, since
    $A_3 \trianglelefteq S_3$, and the only simple cyclic groups are of
    prime order, so $\ZZ_6$ is not simple. This exhausts all of the
    possible cases. 

:::

:::{.problem}
Let $G$ be a finite group and let $N \trianglelefteq G$,
and let $p$ be a prime number and $Q$ a subgroup of $G$ such that
$N \subset Q$ and $Q/N$ is a Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G/N$.

1.  Prove that $Q$ contains a Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G$.

2.  Prove that every Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G/N$ is the image of a Sylow
    $p-$subgroup of $G$.
:::

:::{.solution}
*Proof.*

1.  Since $Q/N$ is a Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G/N$, we can write
    $|G/N| = p^k l$ where $\gcd(p, l) = 1$, and $|Q/N| = p^k$.

    We can then write $|G| = p^n m$ where $n\geq l$ and $l\mid m$.

    By the third isomorphism theorem, we have
    $$\frac{G/N}{Q/N} \cong G/Q$$ and so
    $$\left| \frac{G/N}{Q/N} \right| = \frac{|G/N|}{|Q/N|} = \frac{p^k l}{p^k} = l$$

    and so $|G/Q| = l$ where $(p, l) = 1$, and thus
    $$|G/Q| = |G| / |Q| = l \implies |G| = |Q|~l.$$

    We then have $$p^n m = |Q|~l,$$

    and since $(p, l) = 1$, it must be the case that $p^n$ divides
    $|Q|$. But since $Q \leq G$, this means that $Q$ itself must be a
    Sylow $p-$ subgroup of $G$.

2.  Let $P_N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N)$. By the subgroup correspondence
    theorem, $P_n = H/N$ for some $H\leq G$ such that $N \subseteq H$.

    So choose $P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, H)$; the claim is that
    $P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G)$ and that $\frac{P_HN}{N} \cong P_N$,
    which exhibits $P_N$ as the image of a Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G$.

    We first have $P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G)$, which follows because we
    have $[G/N, H/N] = [G: P_H]$ from the fourth isomorphism theorem,
    and thus $[G/N, P_N] = [G : P_H]$. In particular, since $P_N$ is a
    Sylow $p-$subgroup, $p$ does not divide $[G/N, P_N]$ and thus $p$
    doesn't divide $[G: P_H]$, which makes $P_H$ a maximal $p-$subgroup
    in $G$ and thus a Sylow $p-$subgroup.

    We then have $P_HN/N = P_N$, which follows because
    $P_H \leq H \implies P_HN/N \leq H/N = P_N \leq G/N$.

    However, it is also the case that $P_HN/N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N)$.
    This follows because

    1.  $P_HN/N = P_H/P_H \cap N$ by the 2nd isomorphism theorem, so it
        is a $p-$group.

    2.  $P_H \subseteq P_HN \subseteq G \implies p$ doesn't divide
        $[G: P_HN]$, since $P_H$ is also a Sylow $p-$group of $G$ and
        thus has maximal prime power dividing $\left| G \right|$.

    3.  $N \subseteq P_H N \subseteq G \implies [G/N : P_H N/ N] = [G: P_H N]$

    Taken together, this says that $P_H N/ N$ is a $p$-group and $p$
    doesn't divide $[G/N, P_HN / N]$, so it is a maximal $p-$subgroup
    and $P_HN/N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N)$.

    But since $P_HN/N \leq P_N$ and
    $\left|P_HN/N\right| = \left|P_N\right|$, we must have
    $P_HN/N = P_N$ as desired.

Let $G$ be a finite group and $H<G$ a subgroup. Let

that $n_H$ divides the order of $G$.
:::

:::{.solution}
.* Let $$C_H = \{ gHg^{-1} \mid g\in G \}$$ be the conjugacy class
of $H$, so $|C_H| = n_H$.

We wish to show that $n_{H}$ divides $|G|$.

**Claim 1**: $$n_{H} = [G: N_G(H)],$$ where $N_G(H) \leq G$ is the
normalizer of $H$ in $G$.

Note that if this claim is true, then we can apply Lagrange's theorem,
which states $$A \leq G \implies |G| = [A: G]~|A|,$$

which in this case translates to
$$|G| = [N_G(H) : G]~|N_G(H)| = n_H~|N_G(H)|.$$

Since $n_H$ divides the right-hand side, it must divide the left-hand
side as well, which is precisely what we would like to show.

**Proof of Claim 1**:

The normalizer of $H$ in $G$, written $N_G(H)$, is the largest subgroup
of $G$ containing $H$ such that $H \trianglelefteq N_G(H)$, i.e.
$$N_G(H) = \{g \in G ~\mid~ gHg^{-1} = H \} \leq G.$$

Now consider $S$, the set of left cosets of $N_G(H)$. Suppose there are
$k$ of them, so $$[G: N_G(H)] = |S| \coloneqq k.$$

Then $S$ can be written as
$$S = \{ g_1 N_G(H), ~g_2 N_G(H), ~\cdots, ~g_k N_G(H) \}.$$

where each $g_i$ is a distinct element of $G$ yielding a distinct coset
$g_i N_G(H)$. In particular, if $i\neq j$, then $g_i \neq g_j$, and
$g_i N_G(H) \not \in g_j N_G(H)$.

In particular, $S$ acts on $C_H$, $$\begin{aligned}
S &\curvearrowright C_H \\
g_i N_G(H) &\curvearrowright H = g_i H g_i^{-1},\end{aligned}$$

taking $H$ to one of its conjugate subgroups.

So define $$K \coloneqq 
\{ g_i H g_i^{-1} \mid 1 \leq i \leq k \}.$$

Note that $K \subseteq C_H$, and has at most $k$ elements.

We claim that $K$ has $k$ *distinct* elements, i.e. that each $g_{i}$
takes $H$ to a *distinct* conjugate subgroup. We have $$\begin{aligned}
g_{i} H g^{-1}_{i} 
    &= g_{j} H g^{-1}_{j} &\implies \\
g_j^{-1} g_{i} H g^{-1}_{i} g_j 
    &= H &\implies \\
(g_j^{-1} g_{i}) H (g_j^{-1} g_{i})^{-1} 
    &= H &\implies \\
g_j^{-1} g_{i} &\in N_G(H) &\implies \\
g_i &\in g_j N_G(H) &\implies \\
g_i &= g_j,\end{aligned}$$

where the last line follows because we assumed that each coset contains
at most one $g_i$.

Thus $K$ has $k$ distinct elements, and so
$$= k = |K| \leq |C_H| = n_H.$$

We now claim that $k \geq n_H$ as well.

Let $H' \in C_H$ be any subgroup conjugate to $H$, so $H' = gHg^{-1}$
for some $g\in G$. Then $g = g_i$ for some $i$, so $g \in g_{i} N_G(H)$.

Thus $g = g_{i} n$ for some $n\in N_G(H)$, but
$n\in N_G(H) \iff nHn^{-1} = H$ by definition, and so we have
$$\begin{aligned}
    H' 
    &= gHg^{-1} \\
    &= (g_i n) H (g_i n)^{-1} \\
    &= g_i (n H n^{-1}) g_i^{-1} \\
    &= g_i H g_i^{-1} \in K.\end{aligned}$$

Since $H' \in C_H$ was an arbitrary subgroup conjugate to $H$, this says
that $C_H \subseteq K$ and thus $$n_H = |C_H| \leq |K| = k$$

Thus $$[G: N_G(H)] = k = |M| = |K| = n_H,$$ which is what we wanted to
show. ◻

:::{.claim title="1"}
Conjugacy classes in $S_n$ are completely
determined by cycle type.
:::

This follows because of the result on homework 1, which says that for
any two cycles $\tau,\sigma\in S_n$, we have
$$\tau(s_1~s_2~\cdots~s_k)\tau^{-1} = (\tau(s^1)~\tau(s^2)~\cdots~\tau(s_k)).$$

In particular, this shows that the cycle type of a single cycle is
invariant under conjugation. If an element $\sigma \in S_n$ is comprised
of multiple cycles, say $\sigma = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_\ell$, then
$$\tau(\sigma)\tau^{-1} = \tau(\sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_\ell)\tau^{-1} 
= (\tau\sigma_1\tau^{-1})\cdots(\tau\sigma_\ell\tau^{-1}),$$

which shows that the entire cycle type is preserved under conjugation.
So each conjugacy class has exactly one cycle type, and distinct classes
have distinct cycle types, so this completely determines the conjugacy
classes.

**Claim 2:** Cycle types in $S_n$ are in bijective correspondence with
integer partitions of $n$.

This follows because any integer partition of $n$ can be used to obtain
a canonical representative of a conjugacy class of $S_n$: if
$n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots a_n$, we simply take a cycle of length $a_1$ the
first $a_1$ integers in order, a cycle of length $a_2$ containing the
integers $a_1 + 1$ to $a_2$ in order, and so on.

Conversely, any permutation can be written as a product of disjoint
cycles, and when the cycles for fixed points are added in, every integer
between 1 and $n$ will appear, and the sum of the lengths of all cycles
must sum to $n$. Thus taking the cycle lengths yields an integer
partition of $n$.

All integer partitions of 5 are given below, along with a canonical
representative of the associated conjugacy class. $$\begin{aligned}
    5 && (1~2~3~4~5) \\
    4 + 1 && (1~2~3~4)(5) \\
    3 + 2 &&  (1~2~3)(4~5) \\

    2 + 1 + 1 + 1 && (1~2)(3)(4)(5) \\

B^a B = |B| I_n = p_\phi I_n \in M_n(k[x])
.\]
*If $E$ is a $k[x]$-module with structure induced by $\phi$, and $\psi$ is the $k[x]$-module endomorphism $E\to E$ with matrix given by $B$, then*
\[ 
\psi(u) = x u -\phi(u) = \phi(u) - \phi(u) = 0 && \forall u\in E

1.  Let $\phi,\psi$ be endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional vector
    space $E$ such that $\phi\psi = \psi \phi$. Show that if $E$ has a
    basis of eigenvectors of $\psi$, then it has a basis of eigenvectors
    for both $\psi$ and $\phi$ simultaneously.

2.  Interpret the previous part as a statement about matrices similar to
    a diagonal matrix.

### Qual Problems

:::{.problem}
Let $M \in M_5(R)$ be a $5\times 5$ square matrix with
real coefficients defining a linear map $L: \Bbb{R}^5 \to \Bbb R^5$.
Assume that when considered as an element of $M_5(\Bbb C)$, then the
scalars $0, 1+i, 1+2i$ are eigenvalues of $M$.

1.  Show that the associated linear map $L$ is neither injective nor
    surjective.

2.  Compute the characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial of $M$.

3.  How many fixed points can $L$ have?

    *(That is, how many solutions are there to the equation $L(v) = v$
    with $v\in \Bbb R^5$?)*
