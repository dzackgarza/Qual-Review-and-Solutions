# Topics and Remarks 2

:::{.remark}
Adapted from remark written by Roy Smith, August 2006:

As a general rule, students are responsible for knowing both the theory (proofs) and practical
applications (e.g. **how to find the Jordan or rational canonical form** of a given matrix, **or the Galois group of a given polynomial**) of the topics mentioned.

The **alternating group** is the subgroup of **even** permutations, i.e.
\[
A_n \definedas \theset{\sigma \in S_n \suchthat \sign(\sigma) = 1}
\] 
where $\sign(\sigma) = (-1)^{m}$ and $m$ is the number of cycles of even length.
:::

Q &= \gens{x,y,z \suchthat x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = xyz = -1} \\
  &= \gens{x, y \suchthat  x^4 = y^4, x^2 = y^2, yxy\inv = x\inv}
\]
:::

:::{.definition title="Transitive Subgroup"}
A subgroup of $S_n$ is **transitive** iff its action on $\theset{1, 2, \cdots, n}$ is transitive. 
:::


## Subgroups and Quotients


:::{.fact }
Coprime order subgroups are disjoint, or more generally $\ZZ_p, \ZZ_q \subset G \implies \ZZ_p \intersect \ZZ_q = \ZZ_{(p,q)}$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="The Fundamental Theorem of Cosets"}
\[
aH = bH \iff a\inv b \in H \text{ or } aH \intersect bH = \emptyset
.\]
:::

:::{.theorem title="Counting Quotients"}

\[  
[G: H] = \abs{G/H} = {\abs G \over \abs H}
.\]
:::

:::{.theorem title="Counting by Towers"}

:::

## Special Classes of Groups

### Cyclic Groups

:::{.theorem title="Subgroups of Cyclic Groups"}
If $G$ is cyclic of order $n$, $G$ has a unique subgroup of order $d$ for each $d$ dividing $n$.
:::


### The Symmetric Group

:::{.definition title="Parity of a Cycle"}

- A cycle is **even** $\iff$ product of an *even* number of transpositions.

- A cycle of even *length* is **odd**

- A cycle of odd *length* is **even**

> Mnemonic: the parity of a $k\dash$cycle is the parity of $k-1$.

:::


:::{.corollary title="Alternating Group"}
Every $\sigma \in A_n$ has an even number of *odd* cycles (i.e. an even number of *even-length* cycles).
:::

:::{.example}
\[
A_4 =
& \{\id, \\
& (1,3)(2,4),
(1,2)(3,4),
(1,4)(2,3), \\
& (1,2,3),
(1,3,2), \\
& (1,2,4),
(1,4,2), \\
& (1,3,4),
(1,4,3), \\
& (2,3,4),
(2,4,3) \}
\]
:::



:::{.fact title="Some useful facts"}
\envlist

- $\sigma \circ (a_1 \cdots a_k)\circ \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(a_1), \cdots \sigma(a_k))$
- Conjugacy classes are determined by cycle type
- The order of a cycle is its length.
- The order of an element is the least common multiple of the sizes of its cycles.
- $A_{n\geq 5}$ is *simple*.

:::



## Counting Theorems

:::{.theorem title="Lagrange's Theorem"}
\[H \leq G \implies \abs H \divides \abs G.\]
:::

:::{.corollary}
The order of every element divides the size of $G$, i.e.
  $$
  g\in G \implies o(g) \divides o(G) \implies g^{\abs G} = e
  .$$
:::

:::{.warnings}
There does **not** necessarily exist $H \leq G$ with $\abs H = n$ for every $n \divides \abs{G}$.
Counterexample: $\abs{A_4} = 12$ but has no subgroup of order 6.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Cauchy's Theorem"}
For every prime $p$ dividing $\abs{G}$. there is an element (and thus a subgroup) of order $p$.

> This is a partial converse to Lagrange's theorem, and strengthened by Sylow's theorem.

:::


### Group Actions

:::{.definition title="Group Action"}
An action of $G$ on $X$ is a group morphism
\[
\phi:G \times X &\rightarrow X \\ 
(g,x) &\mapsto g x
\]
or equivalently
\[
\phi: G &\to \Aut(X) \\
g &\mapsto (x \mapsto \phi_g (x) \definedas g\cdot x)
\]
satisfying

1. $e\cdot x = x$
2. $g\cdot (h\cdot x) = (gh)\cdot x$
:::

:::{.fact}
$\ker \psi = \intersect_{x\in X} G_x$ is the intersection of all stabilizers.
:::

:::{.definition title="Transitive Group Action"}
A group action $G\actson X$ is *transitive* iff for all $x, y\in X$ there exists a $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot x = x$.
Equivalently, the action has a single orbit.
:::


:::{.remark title="Reminder of notation"}
For a group $G$ acting on a set $X$,

+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
|  Notation                                                       |  Definition   |
+=================================================================+===============+
| \( G\cdot x = \theset{g\cdot x \suchthat g\in G} \subseteq X \) |  Orbit        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| \(G_x = \ts{ g \in G \st gx=x } \leq G \)                       | Stabilizer    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| \( X/G \subseteq 2^X \)                                         | Set of Orbits |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| \( X^g = \theset{x\in X \suchthat g\cdot x = x} \subseteq X \)  | Fixed Points  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+

Note that being in the same orbit is an equivalence relation which partitions $X$, and $G$ acts transitively if restricted to any single orbit.
:::



:::{.theorem title="Orbit-Stabilizer"}

\[\abs{G\cdot x} = [G: G_x] = \abs{G} / \abs{G_x}\quad \text{if $G$ is finite}
.\]

> Mnemonic: $G/G_x \cong G\cdot x$.

:::


### Examples of Orbit-Stabilizer and the Class Equation

:::{.example title="Trivial"}
Let $G$ act on itself by left translation, where $g \mapsto (h\mapsto gh)$.

- The orbit $\OO_x = Gx = G$ is the entire group

- The stabilizer \( G_x = \ts{ e } \) is only the identity.

- The set of fixed points \( X^g = \ts{ e } \) is only the identity.

:::


:::{.example title="Conjugation yields centers/centralizers"}
Let $G$ act on *itself* by conjugation.

- The orbit $\OO_x = Gx = C(x)$ is the **conjugacy class** of $x$.
  - Note that this means this action is not necessarily transitive.

- $G_x = Z(x) \definedas C_G(x) = \theset{g \in G\suchthat [g, x] = e}$, the **centralizer** of $x$.

- The set of fixed points $X^g = Z(G)$ is the **center**.

:::


:::{.corollary}
The number of conjugates of an element (i.e. the size of its conjugacy class) is the index of its centralizer, $[G: C_G(x)]$, i.e.
\[
\abs{C(x)} = [G: C_G(x)]
.\]

:::


:::{.corollary title="The Class Equation"}
\[
\abs{G} = \abs{Z(G)} + \sum_{\substack{\text{One $x_i$ from} \\ \text{each conjugacy} \\ \text{class}}} [G: C_G(x_i)]
\]
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that $[G: C_G(x_i)]$ is the number of elements in the conjugacy class of $x_i$, and each $x_i \in Z(G)$ has a singleton conjugacy class.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
Let $G$ act on $X \da\ts{H \st H\leq G}$ (its set of *subgroups*) by conjugation.
Let $x = H$ be a subgroup, then

- The orbit $Gx = \theset{gHg\inv}$ is the **set of conjugate subgroups** of $H$

- The stabilizer $G_x = N_G(H)$ is the **normalizer** of in $G$ of $H$

- The fixed points $X^g$ is the set of **normal subgroups** of $G$

:::

:::{.corollary}
Given $H \leq G$, the number of conjugate subgroups is $[G: N_G(H)]$, i.e.
\[
\abs{\ts{ gHg ^{-1} \st g \in G } } = [G: N_G(H)]
.\]

:::


:::{.example title="?"}
For a fixed proper subgroup $H< G$, let $G$ act on its cosets $X \da G/H \da \theset{gH\suchthat g\in G}$ by left translation.
Let $x \da gH$, then

- The orbit $Gx = G/H$, the entire set of cosets.

  - Note that this is a *transitive* action.

- The stabilizer $G_{x} = gHg\inv$, a **conjugate subgroup** of $H$

- The fixed points are $X^G = \emptyset$

:::



:::{.proposition title="Application of the Class Equation"}
If $G$ is simple, $H < G$ proper, and $[G:H] = n$, then there exists an injective map $\phi: G \injects S_n$.
:::

:::{.proof}
This action induces $\phi$; it is nontrivial since $gH = H$ for all $g$ implies $H = G$; $\ker \phi \normal G$ and $G$ simple implies $\ker \phi = 1$.
:::

:::{.corollary title="Burnside's Formula"}
For $G$ a finite group acting on $X$, 
\[
\abs{X/G} = \frac{1}{\abs G }\sum_{g\in G} \abs {X^g}
\]

> Mnemonic: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points, i.e.

:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
\[
\sum_{g\in G} \abs{X^g}
&= \ts{ (g,x) \in G \cross X \st gx = x } \\
&= \sum_{x\in X} \abs{G_x} \\
&= \sum_{x\in X} {\abs{G}\over \abs{Gx}  }  && \text{by Orbit-Stabilizer} \\
&= \abs{G} \sum_{x\in X} {1 \over \abs{Gx}  }  \\
&= \abs{G} \sum_{A\in X/G} \sum_{x\in A} {1\over \abs{A} } && \text{ since } X = \Disjoint_{A \in X/G} A \\
&= \abs{G} \sum_{A\in X/G} 1 \\
&= \abs{G} \abs{X/G}  
.\]
:::


## Isomorphism Theorems

:::{.theorem title="1st Isomorphism Theorem"}
If $\phi:G\to H$ is a group morphism then \[G/\ker \phi \cong \im \phi.\]

Note: for this to make sense, we also have

- $\ker \phi \normal G$
- $\im \phi \leq G$
:::

:::{.corollary}
If $\phi: G\to H$ is surjective then $H\cong G/\ker \phi$.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Diamond Theorem / 2nd Isomorphism Theorem"}
If $S \leq G$ and $N \normal G$, then
\[
\frac{SN}{N} \cong \frac{S}{S\intersect N} \quad \text{ and }\quad \abs{SN} = \frac{\abs S \abs N}{\abs{S\intersect N}}
.\]

![The 2nd "Diamond" Isomorphism Theorem](figures/2020-01-01-15-20-27.png){width=350px}

:::


:::{.remark}
For this to make sense, we also have
    
- $SN \leq G$,
- $S\intersect N \normal S$,

If we relax the conditions to $S, N \leq G$ with $S \in N_G(N)$, then $S\intersect N \normal S$ (but is not normal in $G$) and the 2nd Isomorphism Theorem still holds.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Cancellation / 3rd Isomorphism Theorem"}
Suppose $N, K \leq G$ with $N \normal G$ and $N\subseteq K \subseteq G$.

1. If $K\leq G$ then $K/N \leq G/N$ is a subgroup
2. If $K\normal G$ then $K/N \normal G/N$.
3. Every subgroup of $G/N$ is of the form $K/N$ for some such $K \leq G$.
3. Every *normal* subgroup of $G/N$ is of the form $K/N$ for some such $K \normal G$.
4. If $K\normal G$, then we can cancel normal subgroups:
\[  
\frac{G/N}{K/N} \cong \frac{G}{K}
.\]
:::


:::{.theorem title="The Correspondence Theorem / 4th Isomorphism Theorem"}
Suppose $N \normal G$, then there exists a correspondence:

\[  
\left\{
H < G \suchthat N \subseteq H
\right\}
\mapstofrom
\left\{
H \suchthat H < \frac G N
\right\}
\\
\correspond{
  \text{Subgroups of $G$} \\
  \text{containing $N$}
} \mapstofrom
\correspond{
  \text{Subgroups of the } \\
  \text{quotient $G/N$}
}
.\]

In words, subgroups of $G$ containing $N$ correspond to subgroups of the quotient group $G/N$. This is given by the map $H \mapsto H/N$.
:::


:::{.fact}
$N \normal G$ and $N \subseteq H < G \implies N \normal H$.
:::



## Products

:::{.theorem title="Chinese Remainder Theorem"}
\[
\gcd(p, q) = 1 \implies \ZZ/p\ZZ \cross \ZZ/q\ZZ \cong \ZZ/pq\ZZ
.\]
:::

:::{.theorem title="Recognizing Direct Products"}
We have $G \cong H \times K$ when

- $H, K \normal G$

- $G = HK$.

- $H\intersect K = \theset{e} \subset G$

> Note: can relax to $[h,k] = 1$ for all $h, k$.

:::

:::{.theorem title="Recognizing Generalized Direct Products"}
We have $G \cong \prod_{i=1}^n H_i$ when

- $H_i \normal G$ for all $i$.

- $G = H_1 \cdots H_n$

- $H_k \intersect H_1 \cdots \hat{H_k} \cdots H_n = \emptyset$

> Note on notation: intersect $H_k$ with the amalgam *leaving out* $H_k$.

:::

:::{.theorem title="Recognizing Semidirect Products"}
We have $G \cong N \semidirect_\psi H$ when

- $N \normal G$

- $G =  NH$

- $H \actson N$ by conjugation via a map
  \[  
  \psi: H \to \Aut(N) \\
  h \mapsto h(\wait)h^{-1}
  .\]

> Relaxed condition: $H, N \normal G$ for direct product, or just $H\leq G$ for a semidirect product.

:::

:::{.proposition}
If $H,K \leq G$ and $H \leq N_G(K)$ (or $K \normal G$) then $HK \leq G$ is a subgroup.
:::


## Automorphism Groups

:::{.fact}
\envlist

-  If $\sigma \in \Aut(H)$, then \(N \semidirect_\psi H \cong N \semidirect_{\psi \circ \sigma} H\).

- $\Aut\qty{ \qty{\ZZ/p\ZZ}^n } \cong \GL(n, \FF_p)$, which has size 
\[  
\abs{\Aut(\ZZ/(p)^n)} = (p^n-1)(p^n-p)\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1})
.\]
  
  - If this occurs in a semidirect product, it suffices to consider similarity classes of matrices (i.e. just use canonical forms)

- $\Aut(\ZZ/n\ZZ) \cong \qty{\ZZ/n\ZZ}\units \cong \ZZ/\varphi(n)\ZZ$ where $\varphi$ is the totient function.

  - $\varphi(p^k) = p^{k-1}(p-1)$

- If $G, H$ have coprime order then $\Aut(G \cross H) \cong \Aut(G) \cross  \Aut(H)$.


:::



## Sylow Theorems


:::{.definition}
A **$p\dash$group** is a group $G$ such that every element is order $p^k$ for some $k$.
  If $G$ is a finite $p\dash$group, then $\abs G = p^j$ for some $j$.
:::

Write


- $\abs{G} = p^k m$ where $(p, m) = 1$,
- $S_p$ a Sylow$\dash p$ subgroup, and
- $n_p$ the number of Sylow$\dash p$ subgroups.



### Sylow 1 (Cauchy for Prime Powers)


:::{.theorem title="Sylow 1"}
\[
\forall p^n \text{ dividing } \abs{G} \text{, there exists a subgroup of size } p^n
.\]
:::

Idea: Sylow $p\dash$subgroups exist for any $p$ dividing $\abs{G}$, and are maximal in the sense that every $p\dash$subgroup of $G$ is contained in a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.

If $\abs G = \prod p_i^{\alpha_i}$, then there exist subgroups of order $p_i^{\beta_i}$ for every $i$ and every $0 \leq \beta_i \leq \alpha_i$.
In particular, Sylow $p\dash$subgroups always exist.

### Sylow 2 (Sylows are Conjugate)


:::{.theorem title="Sylow 2"}
All Sylow$\dash p$ subgroups $S_p$ are conjugate, i.e.
\[
S_p^i, S_p^j \in \mathrm{Syl}_p(G) \implies \exists g \text{ such that } g S_p^i g\inv = S_p^j
\]

:::


:::{.corollary}
\[
n_p = 1 \iff S_p \normal G
.\]
:::

### Sylow 3 (Numerical Constraints)


:::{.theorem title="Sylow 3"}
\envlist

1. $n_p \divides m~$ (in particular, $n_p \leq m$),

2. $n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$,

3. $n_p = [G : N_G(S_p)]$ where $N_G$ is the normalizer.

:::



:::{.corollary}
$p$ does not divide $n_p$.
:::

:::{.proposition}
Every $p\dash$subgroup of $G$ is contained in a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.
:::
:::{.proof}
Let $H \leq G$ be a $p\dash$subgroup.
If $H$ is not *properly* contained in any other $p\dash$subgroup, it is a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup by definition.
Otherwise, it is contained in some $p\dash$subgroup $H^1$.
Inductively this yields a chain $H \subsetneq H^1 \subsetneq \cdots$, and by Zorn's lemma $H\definedas \union_i H^i$ is maximal and thus a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.
:::

## Special Classes of Groups

:::{.definition title="2 out of 3 Property"}
The **"2 out of 3 property"** is satisfied by a class of groups $\mathcal{C}$ iff whenever $G \in \mathcal{C}$, then $N, G/N \in \mathcal{C}$ for any $N \normal G$.
:::

:::{.definition title="p-groups"}
If $\abs{G} = p^k$, then $G$ is a **p-group.**
:::

:::{.definition title="Normalizers Grow"}
If for every proper $H<G$, $H\normal N_G(H)$ is again proper, then "normalizers grow" in $G$.
:::

## Classification of Groups

General strategy: find a normal subgroup (usually a Sylow) and use recognition of semidirect products.

- [Keith Conrad: Classifying Groups of Order 12](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/grouptheory/group12.pdf)
- Order $p$: cyclic.
- Order $p^2q$: ?


### Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

:::{.definition title="Invariant Factor Decomposition"}
$$
G \cong \ZZ^r \times \prod_{j=1}^m \ZZ/n_j\ZZ
\quad \text{ where } n_1 \divides \cdots \divides n_m
.$$
:::

**Invariant factors $\to$ Elementary Divisors:**

- Take prime factorization of each factor
- Split into coprime pieces

:::{.example}
\[
\ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7}
\cong
\ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{2^3} \times \ZZ_{5^2} \times \ZZ_7
\]
:::

**Going from elementary divisors to invariant factors:**

- Bin up by primes occurring (keeping exponents)
- Take highest power from each prime as *last* invariant factor
- Take highest power from all remaining primes as next, etc

:::{.example}
Given the invariant factor decomposition
\[
G = {\ZZ_{2}\times\ZZ_{2}\times\ZZ_{2}\times\ZZ_{3}\times\ZZ_{3}\times\ZZ_{5^2}}
\]

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2,2,2$ |  $3,3$ | $5^2$

$\implies n_m = 5^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2,2$ |  $3$ | $\emptyset$

$\implies n_{m-1} = 3 \cdot 2$

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2$ |  $\emptyset$ | $\emptyset$

$\implies n_{m-2} = 2$

and thus
\[
G\cong \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{3\cdot 2} \times \ZZ_{5^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}
\]
:::

### Classifying Abelian Groups of a Given Order


Let $p(x)$ be the integer partition function.


:::{.example title="?"}
Example: $p(6) = 11$, given by
\[
&[6], \\
&[5, 1], \\
&[4, 2], \\
&[4, 1, 1], \\
&[3, 3], \\
&[3, 2, 1], \\
&[3, 1, 1, 1], \\
&[2, 2, 2], \\
&[2, 2, 1, 1], \\
&[2, 1, 1, 1, 1], \\
&[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
.\]

:::

Write $G = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots$; then there are $p(k_1) p(k_2) \cdots$ choices, each yielding a distinct group.

:::

:::{.definition title="Lower Central Series"}
Set $G^0 = G$ and $G^{i+1} = [G, G^i]$, then $G^0 \geq G^1 \geq \cdots$ is the *lower central series* of $G$.
:::

> Mnemonic: "lower" because the chain is descending.
> Iterate the adjoint map $[\wait, G]$, if this terminates then the map is nilpotent, so call $G$ nilpotent!

:::{.definition title="Upper Central Series"}
Set $Z_0 = 1$, $Z_1 = Z(G)$, and $Z_{i+1} \leq G$ to be the subgroup satisfying $Z_{i+1}/Z_i = Z(G/Z_i)$.
Then $Z_0 \leq Z_1 \leq \cdots$ is the *upper central series* of $G$.

Equivalently, since $Z_i\normal G$, there is a quotient map $\pi:G\to G/Z_i$, so define $Z_{i+1} \definedas \pi\inv(Z(G/Z_i))$ (?).

> Mnemonic: "upper" because the chain is ascending. "Take higher centers".

:::

:::{.definition title="Derived Series"}
Set $G^{(0)} = G$ and $G^{(i+1)} = [G^{(i)}, G^{(i)}]$, then $G^{(0)} \geq G^{(1)} \geq \cdots$ is the *derived series* of $G$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Solvable"}
A group $G$ is **solvable** iff $G$ has a terminating normal series with abelian composition factors, i.e.
\[
G \to G^1 \to \cdots \to \theset{e} \text{ with } G^{i}/G^{i+1}\text{ abelian for all } i
.\]
:::

:::{.theorem title="Characterization of Solvable"}
A group $G$ is solvable iff its derived series terminates.
:::

:::{.theorem title="$S_n$ is Almost Always Solvable"}
If $n\geq 4$ then $S_n$ is solvable.

- Abelian $\implies$ solvable
- Every group of order less than 60 is solvable.

- $R$ a PID $\implies R[x]$ is a UFD

:::{.proposition}
Fields $\subset$ Euclidean domains  $\subset$  PIDs $\subset$ UFDs $\subset$ Integral Domains  $\subset$ Rings

:::{.example}
- A Euclidean Domain that is not a field: $\FF[x]$ for $\FF$ a field
  - *Proof*: Use previous lemma, and $x$ is not invertible

- A PID that is not a Euclidean Domain: $\ZZ\left[\frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2}\right]$.
  - *Proof*: complicated.

- A UFD that is not a PID: $\FF[x, y]$.
  - *Proof*: $\gens{x, y}$ is not principal

   - *Proof*: $(2+\sqrt{-5})(2-\sqrt{-5})=9=3\cdot 3$, where all factors are irreducible (check norm).

:::

Note: For $R$ an integral domain, prime $\implies$ irreducible, but generally not the converse.

$x^2 \mod (x^2 + x) \in \QQ[x]/(x^2 + x)$. Check that $x$ is prime directly, but $x=x\cdot x$ and $x$ is not a unit.

Every ring has proper maximal ideals, and any proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.

## Zorn's Lemma

:::{.theorem title="Zorn's Lemma"}
If $P$ is a poset in which every chain has an upper bound, then $P$ has a maximal element.
:::

:::{.proposition}
Fields are simple rings. 
:::

:::{.proposition}
If $I\normal R$ is a proper ideal $\iff I$ contains no units.
:::

:::{.proof}
$r\in R\units \intersect I \implies r\inv r \in I \implies 1\in I \implies x\cdot 1 \in I \quad \forall x\in R$.
:::

:::{.proposition}
If $I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq \cdots$ are ideals then $\union_j I_j$ is an ideal.
:::

:::{.proposition}
Every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $0 < I < R$ be a proper ideal, and consider the set
$$
S = \theset{J \suchthat I   \subseteq J < R}
.$$

Note $I\in S$, so $S$ is nonempty.
The claim is that $S$ contains a maximal element $M$.

$S$ is a poset, ordered by set inclusion, so if we can show that every chain has an upper bound, we can apply Zorn's lemma to produce $M$.

Let $C \subseteq S$ be a chain in $S$, so $C = \theset{C_1 \subseteq C_2 \subseteq \cdots}$ and define $\hat{C} = \union_i C_i$.

**$\hat{C}$ is an upper bound for $C$:**
This follows because every $C_i \subseteq \hat{C}$.

**$\hat{C}$ is in $S$:**
Use the fact that $I \subseteq C_i < R$ for every $C_i$ and since no $C_i$ contains a unit, $\hat{C}$ doesn't contain a unit, and is thus proper.
:::

:::{.example title="An irreducible element that is not prime."}
$3\in \ZZ[\sqrt{-5}]$. 
Check norm to see irreducibility, but $3 \divides 9 = (2+\sqrt{-5})(2-\sqrt{-5})$ and doesn't divide either factor.

:::

:::{.definition title="Normal Field Extension"}
Let $L/k$ be a finite extension.
Then TFAE:

- $L/k$ is **normal**.

- Every irreducible $f\in k[x]$ that has one root in $L$ has *all* of its roots in $L$

:::{.theorem title="Finite Extensions are Algebraic"}
Every finite extension is algebraic.
:::

:::{.proof}
If \( K/F \) and \( [K:F] = n \), then pick any \( \alpha \in K \) and consider \( 1, \alpha , \alpha ^2, ...  \).
This yields \( n+1 \) elements in an \( n\dash \)dimensional vector space, and thus there is a linear dependence \[
f(\alpha ) \da \sum_{j=1}^n c_j \alpha ^j = 0
.\]
But then \( \alpha \) is the root of the polynomial \( f \).
:::

:::{.theorem title="Gauss' Lemma"}
Let $R$ be a UFD and $F$ its field of fractions.
Then a primitive $p\in R[x]$ is irreducible in $R[x] \iff p$ is irreducible in $F[x]$.

:::{.proposition title="Identification of Finite Fields as Splitting Fields"}
$\GF(p^n)$ is the splitting field of $\rho(x) = x^{p^n} - x$, and the elements are exactly the roots of $\rho$.
:::

:::{.proof}
Todo.
Every element is a root by Cauchy's theorem, and the $p^n$ roots are distinct since its derivative is identically $-1$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Splits Product of Irreducibles"}
Let $\rho_n \definedas x^{p^n} - x$.
Then $f(x) \divides \rho_n(x) \iff \deg f \divides n$ and $f$ is irreducible.
:::

:::{.corollary}
$x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i \in \FF_p[x]$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$.
:::

:::{.proof}
$\impliedby$:

- Suppose $f$ is irreducible of degree $d$.
- Then $f \divides x^{p^d} - x$, by considering $F[x]/\gens{f}$.
- Thus $x^{p^d} - x \divides x^{p^n} - x \iff d\divides n$.

$\implies$:

- $\alpha \in \GF(p^n) \iff \alpha^{p^n} - \alpha = 0$, so every element is a root of $\phi_n$ and $\deg \min(\alpha, \FF_p) \divides n$ since $\FF_p(\alpha)$ is an intermediate extension.

- So if $f$ is an irreducible factor of $\phi_n$, $f$ is the minimal polynomial of some root $\alpha$ of $\phi_n$, so $\deg f \divides n$.

-  $\phi_n'(x) = p^nx^{p^{n-1}} \neq 0$, so $\phi_n$ has distinct roots and thus no repeated factors. So $\phi_n$ is the product of all such irreducible $f$.
:::

:::{.proposition}
No finite field is algebraically closed.
:::

:::{.proof}
If \( k = \ts{ a_1, a_2, \cdots a_n } \)  then define the polynomial 
\[
f(x) \da 1 +\prod_{j=1}^n (x-a_j) \in k[x]

This has no roots in $k$.

### Common Counterexamples

- $\QQ(\zeta_3, 2^{1/3})$ is normal but $\QQ(2^{1/3})$ is not since the irreducible polynomial $x^3 - 2$ has only one root in it.


## Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory

:::{.theorem title="Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory"}
Let $L/k$ be a Galois extension, then there is a correspondence:
\[
\correspond{\text{Subgroups } H \leq \Gal(L/k)}
&\mapstofrom
\correspond{\text{Fields }  F \text{ such}\\ \text{that } L/F/k} \\
H &\rightarrow \correspond{E^H \definedas ~\text{The fixed field of $H$}} \\
\correspond{\Gal(L/F) \definedas \theset{ \sigma \in \Gal(L/k) \suchthat \sigma(F) = F}} &\leftarrow F
\]

- This is contravariant with respect to subgroups/subfields.

- $[F: k] = [G: H]$, so degrees of extensions over the base field correspond to indices of subgroups.

- $[K : F] = \abs{H}$

- $L/F$ is Galois and $Gal(K/F) = H$

- $F/k$ is Galois $\iff H$ is normal, and $\Gal(F/k) = \Gal(L/k)/H$.

- The compositum $F_1 F_2$ corresponds to $H_1 \intersect H_2$.

- The subfield $F_1 \intersect F_2$ corresponds to $H_1 H_2$.

2.
\[
x^{n}-1=\prod_{d | n} \Phi_{d}(x) \implies \Phi_n(x) = \frac{x^n-1}{\prod_{d | n \atop d < n} \Phi_{d}(x)},

# Modules

## General Modules


:::{.definition title="Simple Module"}
A module is **simple** iff it has no nontrivial proper submodules.
:::


:::{.definition title="Free Module"}
A **free** module is a module with a basis (i.e. a spanning, linearly independent set).
:::


:::{.definition title="Torsionfree"}
A module \( M \) is **torsion-free** if and only if for every \( x\in M \), \( mx = 0_M \implies m=0_M \).
I.e. the only torsion element of \( M \) is zero itself.
:::


:::{.fact}
Free \( \implies \) torsionfree.
:::



:::{.example title="?"}
$\ZZ/(6)$ is a $\ZZ\dash$module that is *not* free, since the element \( [3] \) is a torsion element, where \( 2[3] = [6] = [0] \).
:::



:::{.definition title="Projective Modules"}
A module $M$ is **projective** iff $M$ is a direct summand of a free module $F = M \oplus \cdots$.
:::



:::{.example title="?"}
Free implies projective, but not the converse.
Let \( R_1, R_2 \) be two nontrivial rings and set \( R \da R_1 \oplus R_2 \).
Then \( R_1, R_2 \) are projective \( R\dash \)modules by construction, but each factor contains \( R\dash \)torsion:
setting \( e \da (0, 1) \in R \) we have \( e \actson R_1 = 0_{R_1} \).
Since free implies torsionfree, \( R_1 \) can not be a free \(R\dash\)module.
:::




:::{.definition title="Exact Sequences"}
A sequence of \(R\dash\)module morphisms $0 \mapsvia{d_1} A \mapsvia{d_2} B \mapsvia{d_3} C \to 0$ is *exact* iff $\im d_i = \ker d_{i+1}$.
:::



:::{.proposition title="Splitting Exact Seueqnces"}
If $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ is a short exact sequence, then

- $C$ free $\implies$ the sequence splits
- $C$ projective $\implies$ the sequence splits
- $A$ injective $\implies$ the sequence splits

Moreover, if this sequence splits, then $B \cong A \oplus C$.
:::


## Classification of Modules over a PID

Let $M$ be a finitely generated modules over a PID $R$.
Then there is an invariant factor decomposition

\begin{align*}
M \cong F \bigoplus R/(r_i) \quad\text{where } r_1 \divides r_2 \divides \cdots
\end{align*}

and similarly an elementary divisor decomposition.


:::{.proposition title="Principal Ideals are Free"}
$I \normal R$ is a free $R\dash$module iff $I$ is a principal ideal.
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
$\implies$:

Suppose $I$ is free as an $R\dash$module, and let $B = \theset{\vector m_j}_{j\in J} \subseteq I$ be a basis so we can write $M = \generators{B}$.
Suppose that $\abs{B} \geq 2$, so we can pick at least 2 basis elements $\vector m_1\neq \vector m_2$, and consider
$$
\vector c = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_2 \vector m_1,
$$

which is also an element of $M$ .
Since $R$ is an integral domain, $R$ is commutative, and so
$$
\vector c = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_2 \vector m_1 = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_1 \vector m_2 = \vector 0_M
$$

However, this exhibits a linear dependence between $\vector m_1$ and $\vector m_2$, namely that there exist $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \neq 0_R$ such that $\alpha_1 \vector m_1 + \alpha_2 \vector m_2 = \vector 0_M$; this follows because $M \subset R$ means that we can take $\alpha_1 = -m_2, \alpha_2 = m_1$. This contradicts the assumption that $B$ was a basis, so we must have $\abs{B} = 1$ and so $B = \theset{\vector m}$ for some $\vector m \in I$. But then $M = \generators{B} = \generators{\vector m}$ is generated by a single element, so $M$ is principal.

$\impliedby$:
Suppose $M\normal R$ is principal, so $M = \generators{\vector m}$ for some $\vector m \neq \vector{0}_M \in M \subset R$.

Then $x\in M \implies x = \alpha\vector m$ for some element $\alpha\in R$ and we just need to show that $\alpha\vector m = \vector 0_M \implies \alpha = 0_R$ in order for $\theset{\vector m}$ to be a basis for $M$, making $M$ a free $R\dash$module.
But since $M \subset R$, we have $\alpha, m \in R$ and $\vector 0_M = 0_R$, and since $R$ is an integral domain, we have $\alpha m = 0_R \implies \alpha = 0_R$ or $m = 0_R$.
Since $m \neq 0_R$, this forces $\alpha = 0_R$, which allows $\theset{m}$ to be a linearly independent set and thus a basis for $M$ as an $R\dash$module.

## Finding Minimal Polynomials

Let $m(x)$ denote the minimal polynomial $A$.

1. Find the characteristic polynomial $\chi(x)$; this annihilates $A$ by Cayley-Hamilton. Then $m(x) \divides \chi(x)$, so just test the finitely many products of irreducible factors.

2. Pick any $\vector v$ and compute $T\vector v, T^2\vector v, \cdots T^k\vector v$ until a linear dependence is introduced. Write this as $p(T) = 0$; then $\min_A(x) \divides p(x)$.


:::{.definition title="Companion Matrix"}
Given a monic $p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + x^n$, the **companion matrix** of $p$ is given by

where each $a_i$ is an invariant factor.
:::



:::{.proposition title="RCG Relates to Invariant Factors"}
$RCF(A)$ is a block matrix where each block is the companion matrix of an invariant factor of $A$.
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
The derivation:

- Let $k[x] \actson V$ using $T$, makes $V$ into a $k[x]\dash$module. 

- $k$ a field implies $k[x]$ a PID, so apply structure theorem to obtain invariant factors $a_i$,

- Note that $T\actson V$ by multiplication by $x$

- Write $\bar x = \pi(x)$ where $F[x] \mapsvia{\pi} F[x]/(a_i)$; then $\spanof\theset{\overline x} = F[x]/(a_i)$.

- Write $a_i(x) = \sum b_i x^i$, note that $V \to F[x]$ pushes $T\actson V$ to $T\actson k[x]$ by multiplication by $\overline x$

- WRT the basis $\overline x$, $T$ then acts via the companion matrix on this summand.

- Each invariant factor corresponds to a block of the RCF.


:::

### Jordan Canonical Form

Corresponds to the **Elementary Divisor Decomposition** of $T$.


:::{.lemma title="?"}
The elementary divisors of $A$ are the minimal polynomials of the Jordan blocks.
:::

\begin{align*}
\min_A(x) = \prod (x- \lambda_i)^{a_i} \\
\chi_A(x) = \prod (x- \lambda_i)^{b_i}
\end{align*}

- The roots both polynomials are precisely the eigenvalues of $A$

- The spectrum of $A$ corresponds precisely to the **characteristic** polynomial 

- $a_i \leq b_i$

- $a_i$ is the size of the **largest** Jordan block associated to $\lambda_i$,

- $b_i$ is the **sum of sizes** of all Jordan blocks associated to $\lambda_i$ and the number of times $\lambda_i$ appears on the diagonal of $JCF(A)$.

- $\dim E_{\lambda_i}$ is the **number of Jordan blocks** associated to $\lambda_i$

:::

## Diagonalizability

*Notation:*
$A^*$ denotes the conjugate tranpose of $A$.



:::{.lemma title="?"}
Let $V$ be a vector space over $k$ an algebraically closed and $A \in \mathrm{End}(V)$.
Then if $W \subseteq V$ is an invariant subspace, so $A(W) \subseteq W$, the $A$ has an eigenvector in $W$.
:::



:::{.theorem title="The Spectral Theorem"}
\envlist

1. Hermitian matrices (i.e. $A^* = A$) are diagonalizable over $\CC$.
2. Symmetric matrices (i.e. $A^t = A$) are diagonalizable over $\RR$.
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
\envlist

- Suppose $A$ is Hermitian.
- Since $V$ itself is an invariant subspace, $A$ has an eigenvector $\vector v_1 \in V$.
- Let $W_1 = \spanof_k\theset{\vector v_1}\perp$.
- Then for any $\vector w_1 \in W_1$, 
$$
\inner{\vector v_1}{ A \vector w_1} =
\inner{A \vector v_1}{\vector w_1} =
\lambda \inner{\vector v_1}{\vector w_1} = 0,
$$
so $A(W_1) \subseteq W_1$ is an invariant subspace, etc.

- Suppose now that $A$ is symmetric.
- Then there is an eigenvector of norm 1, $\vector v \in V$.
\begin{align*}
\lambda = \lambda\inner{\vector v}{\vector v} = \inner{A\vector v}{\vector v} = \inner{\vector v}{A\vector v} = \overline{\lambda} \implies \lambda \in \RR

By induction on number of operators

- $A_n$ is diagonalizable, so $V = \bigoplus E_i$ a sum of eigenspaces
- Restrict all $n-1$ operators $A$ to $E_n$.
- The commute in $V$ so they commute in $E_n$
- **(Lemma)** They were diagonalizable in $V$, so they're diagonalizable in $E_n$
- So they're simultaneously diagonalizable by I.H.
- But these eigenvectors for the $A_i$ are all in $E_n$, so they're eigenvectors for $A_n$ too.

## Ring Theory

Basic Structure

- Show that if an ideal $I\normal R$ contains a unit then $I = R$.
- Show that $R\units$ need not be closed under addition.

Ideals

:::{.problem title="Units or Zero Divisors"}
Every $a\in R$ for a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor.
:::
:::{.solution}
\hfill
- Let $a\in R$ and define $\phi(x) = ax$.
- If $\phi$ is injective, then it is surjective, so $1 = ax$ for some $x \implies x\inv = a$.
- Otherwise, $ax_1 = ax_2$ with $x_1 \neq x_2 \implies a(x_1 - x_2) = 0$ and $x_1 - x_2 \neq 0$
- So $a$ is a zero divisor.
:::

:::{.problem title="Maximal implies prime"}
Maximal $\implies$ prime, but generally not the converse.
:::
:::{.solution}

- Suppose $\mm$ is maximal, $ab\in \mm$, and $b\not\in \mm$.

- Then there is a containment of ideals $\mm \subsetneq \mm + (b) \implies \mm + (b) = R$.

- So
\[
1 = m + rb \implies a = am + r(ab)
,\]
  but $am\in \mm$ and $ab\in \mm \implies a\in \mm$.


*Counterexample*: 
$(0) \in \ZZ$ is prime since $\ZZ$ is a domain, but not maximal since it is properly contained in any other ideal.
:::


- Show that every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal
- Show that if $x\in R$ a PID, then $x$ is irreducible $\iff \gens{x}\normal R$ is maximal.
- Show that intersections, products, and sums of ideals are ideals.

- Show that every prime ideal is radical.
- Show that the nilradical is given by $\nilrad(R) = \rad(0)$.
- Show that $\text{rad}(IJ) = \text{rad}(I) \intersect \text{rad}(J)$
- Show that if $\spec(R) \subseteq \maxspec(R)$ then $R$ is a UFD.
- Show that if $R$ is Noetherian then every ideal is finitely generated.

Characterizing Certain Ideals

- Show that the nilradical of a ring is the intersection of all prime ideals $I\normal R$.
- Show that for an ideal $I\normal R$, its radical is the intersection of all prime ideals containing $I$.
- Show that $\rad(I)$ is the intersection of all prime ideals containing $I$.

:::{.problem title="Jacobson radical is bigger than the nilradical"}
The nilradical is contained in the Jacobson radical, i.e.
\[
\mathfrak \nilrad (R) \subseteq \jacobsonrad(R)
.\]
:::
:::{.solution}
Maximal $\implies$ prime, and so if $x$ is in every prime ideal, it is necessarily in every maximal ideal as well.
:::

:::{.problem title="Mod by nilradical to kill nilpotents"}
$R/\mathfrak \nilrad(R)$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements.
:::
:::{.solution}
\hfill
\[
a + \mathfrak N(R)\text{ nilpotent } &\implies (a+ \mathfrak N(R))^n \definedas a^n + \mathfrak N(R)= \mathfrak N(R) \\
&\implies a^n \in \mathfrak N(R) \\
&\implies \exists \ell \text{ such that } (a^n)^\ell = 0 \\
&\implies a\in \mathfrak N(R)
.
\]
:::

:::{.problem title="Nilradical is intersection of primes"}
The nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals, i.e.
\[
\mathfrak{N}(R) = \intersect_{\mathfrak{p} \in \spec(R)} \mathfrak{p}
\]
:::
:::{.solution}
- $\mathfrak{N} \subseteq \intersect \mathfrak{p}$:

- $x \in \mathfrak{N} \implies x^n = 0 \in \mathfrak p \implies x\in \mathfrak{p} \text{ or } x^{n-1}\in\mathfrak p$.

- $\mathfrak{N}^c \subseteq \union \mathfrak{p}^c$:

- Define $S = \theset{I\normal R \suchthat a^n\not\in I \text{ for any } n}$.

- Then apply Zorn's lemma to get a maximal ideal $\mm$, and maximal $\implies$ prime.
:::

Misc

- Show that localizing a ring at a prime ideal produces a local ring.
- Show that $R$ is a local ring iff for every $x\in R$, either $x$ or $1-x$ is a unit.
- Show that if $R$ is a local ring then $R\setminus R\units$ is a proper ideal that is contained in $\jacobsonrad(R)$.
- Show that if $R\neq 0$ is a ring in which every non-unit is nilpotent then $R$ is local.

### Qual Problems

:::{.problem}
Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime number. Let
$X_p$ be the set of Sylow-$p$ subgroups of $G$ and $n_p$ be the
cardinality of $X_p$. Let $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ be the permutation group on
the set $X_p$.

1.  Construct a homomorphism $\rho: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X_p)$ with image
    a transitive subgroup (i.e. with a single orbit).

2.  Deduce that if $G$ is simple then the order of $G$ divides $n_p!$.

3.  Show that for any $1\leq a \leq 4$ and any prime power $p^k$, no
    group of order $ap^k$ is simple.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

1.  Define the required group action by $$\begin{aligned}
            \rho: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \\
            g \mapsto (\gamma_g: P \mapsto gPg^{-1}).
        \end{aligned}$$ The claim is that this action is transitive on
    $X_p$. This can be equivalently stated as
    $$\forall P \in X_p, \exists g \in G, P' \in X_p \mid gP'g^{-1} = P.$$

    However, by Sylow 2, all Sylow $p-$subgroups are conjugate to each
    other, and thus this condition is satisfied.

2.  Suppose that $G$ is simple, so that we have
    $$H \trianglelefteq G \implies H = \{ e \} \text{ or } H = G.$$

    Note that $\mathrm{Sym}(X_p) = (n_p)!$, and if we have an injective
    homomorphism $G \xrightarrow{\phi} \mathrm{Sym}(X_p)$, then
    $|G| = |\phi(G)|$, since $\phi(G) \leq \mathrm{Sym}(X_p)$ will be a
    subgroup and thus have order dividing $(n_p)!$, which proves the
    statement.

    Using the $\phi$ defined in (1), we can apply the first isomorphism
    theorem
    $$G / \ker \phi \cong \mathrm{im} \phi \leq \mathrm{Sym}(X_p),$$ and
    so it suffices to show that $\ker \phi = \{e\}$.

    Note that since $\ker \phi \trianglelefteq G$ and $G$ is simple, we
    can only have $\ker \phi = \{e\}$ or $\ker \phi = G$.

    Towards a contradiction, suppose $\ker \phi = G$.

    By definition, we have $$\begin{aligned}
        \ker \phi &= \{ g\in G \mid \gamma_g = \mathrm{id}_{X_p} \} \\
        &= \{ g\in G \mid \forall P \in X_p,~ gPg^{-1} = P \} \\
        &= \bigcap_{P \in X_p} N_G(P),
        \end{aligned}$$

    and so the kernel of $\varphi$ is the intersection of all of the
    normalizers of the Sylow $p-$subgroups.

    But this means that $N_G(P) = G$ for every Sylow $p-$subgroup, which
    means that $n_p = 1$ and there is a unique $P$ which must be normal
    in $G$. Since $G$ is simple, this forces $P$ to be trivial or the
    whole group.

    Towards a contradiction, suppose $P = G$. Then $G$ is a $p-$group
    and thus has order $p^n$. But then $G$ has normal subgroups of order
    $p^k$ for all $0 < k < n$, contradicting the simplicity of $G$.

    But the only other option is that $P$ is trivial, whereas we know
    nontrivial Sylow $p-$subgroups exist by Sylow 1.

    Thus we can not have $\ker \phi = G$, and so $\ker \phi$ is trivial
    as desired.

3.  Suppose $\left| G \right| = ap^k$, where $1 \leq a \leq 4$. Then by
    Sylow 3, we have $n_p = 1 \mod p$ and $n_p$ divides $a$. If $a=1$,
    then $n_p = 1$, and so $G$ can not be simple. Moreover, if
    $p \geq a$, then $n_p \leq a$ and $n_p = 1\mod p$ forces $n_p = 1$
    again.

    So we can restrict our attention to $2 \leq a \leq 4$ and
    $p = 2, 3$, which reduces to checking the cases
    $ap^k = 2 (3^k), 4 (3^k)$, or $3 (2^k)$ for $k\geq 1$.

    If $ap^k = 2(3^k)$, we have $n_3 = 1 \mod 3$ and $n_3 \divides 2$,
    which forces $n_3 = 1$, so this can not be a simple group.

    Similarly, if $ap^k = 4(3^k)$, then $n_3 = 1 \mod 3$ and $n_3$
    divides 4, which forces $n_3 = 1$ and thus $G$ can't be simple.

    If $ap^k = 3(2^k)$, then $n_2 = 1 \mod 2$ and $n_2$ divides 3, so
    $n_2 = 1, 3$. But then $n_3! = 6$, and if $k > 1$, we have
    $3(2^k) > 6 = n_3!$, so $G$ can not be simple by the result in (2).

    If $k = 1$, then $G$ is order 6, so $G$ is isomorphic to either
    $\ZZ_6$ or $S_3$. The group $S_3$ is not simple, since
    $A_3 \trianglelefteq S_3$, and the only simple cyclic groups are of
    prime order, so $\ZZ_6$ is not simple. This exhausts all of the
    possible cases. 

:::

:::{.problem}
Let $G$ be a finite group and let $N \trianglelefteq G$,
and let $p$ be a prime number and $Q$ a subgroup of $G$ such that
$N \subset Q$ and $Q/N$ is a Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G/N$.

1.  Prove that $Q$ contains a Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G$.

2.  Prove that every Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G/N$ is the image of a Sylow
    $p-$subgroup of $G$.
:::

:::{.solution}
*Proof.*

1.  Since $Q/N$ is a Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G/N$, we can write
    $|G/N| = p^k l$ where $\gcd(p, l) = 1$, and $|Q/N| = p^k$.

    We can then write $|G| = p^n m$ where $n\geq l$ and $l\mid m$.

    By the third isomorphism theorem, we have
    $$\frac{G/N}{Q/N} \cong G/Q$$ and so
    $$\left| \frac{G/N}{Q/N} \right| = \frac{|G/N|}{|Q/N|} = \frac{p^k l}{p^k} = l$$

    and so $|G/Q| = l$ where $(p, l) = 1$, and thus
    $$|G/Q| = |G| / |Q| = l \implies |G| = |Q|~l.$$

    We then have $$p^n m = |Q|~l,$$

    and since $(p, l) = 1$, it must be the case that $p^n$ divides
    $|Q|$. But since $Q \leq G$, this means that $Q$ itself must be a
    Sylow $p-$ subgroup of $G$.

2.  Let $P_N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N)$. By the subgroup correspondence
    theorem, $P_n = H/N$ for some $H\leq G$ such that $N \subseteq H$.

    So choose $P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, H)$; the claim is that
    $P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G)$ and that $\frac{P_HN}{N} \cong P_N$,
    which exhibits $P_N$ as the image of a Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G$.

    We first have $P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G)$, which follows because we
    have $[G/N, H/N] = [G: P_H]$ from the fourth isomorphism theorem,
    and thus $[G/N, P_N] = [G : P_H]$. In particular, since $P_N$ is a
    Sylow $p-$subgroup, $p$ does not divide $[G/N, P_N]$ and thus $p$
    doesn't divide $[G: P_H]$, which makes $P_H$ a maximal $p-$subgroup
    in $G$ and thus a Sylow $p-$subgroup.

    We then have $P_HN/N = P_N$, which follows because
    $P_H \leq H \implies P_HN/N \leq H/N = P_N \leq G/N$.

    However, it is also the case that $P_HN/N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N)$.
    This follows because

    1.  $P_HN/N = P_H/P_H \cap N$ by the 2nd isomorphism theorem, so it
        is a $p-$group.

    2.  $P_H \subseteq P_HN \subseteq G \implies p$ doesn't divide
        $[G: P_HN]$, since $P_H$ is also a Sylow $p-$group of $G$ and
        thus has maximal prime power dividing $\left| G \right|$.

    3.  $N \subseteq P_H N \subseteq G \implies [G/N : P_H N/ N] = [G: P_H N]$

    Taken together, this says that $P_H N/ N$ is a $p$-group and $p$
    doesn't divide $[G/N, P_HN / N]$, so it is a maximal $p-$subgroup
    and $P_HN/N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N)$.

    But since $P_HN/N \leq P_N$ and
    $\left|P_HN/N\right| = \left|P_N\right|$, we must have
    $P_HN/N = P_N$ as desired.

Let $G$ be a finite group and $H<G$ a subgroup. Let

:::

:::{.solution}
.* Let $$C_H = \{ gHg^{-1} \mid g\in G \}$$ be the conjugacy class
of $H$, so $|C_H| = n_H$.

We wish to show that $n_{H}$ divides $|G|$.

**Claim 1**: $$n_{H} = [G: N_G(H)],$$ where $N_G(H) \leq G$ is the
normalizer of $H$ in $G$.

Note that if this claim is true, then we can apply Lagrange's theorem,
which states $$A \leq G \implies |G| = [A: G]~|A|,$$

which in this case translates to
$$|G| = [N_G(H) : G]~|N_G(H)| = n_H~|N_G(H)|.$$

Since $n_H$ divides the right-hand side, it must divide the left-hand
side as well, which is precisely what we would like to show.

**Proof of Claim 1**:

The normalizer of $H$ in $G$, written $N_G(H)$, is the largest subgroup
of $G$ containing $H$ such that $H \trianglelefteq N_G(H)$, i.e.
$$N_G(H) = \{g \in G ~\mid~ gHg^{-1} = H \} \leq G.$$

Now consider $S$, the set of left cosets of $N_G(H)$. Suppose there are
$k$ of them, so $$[G: N_G(H)] = |S| \coloneqq k.$$

Then $S$ can be written as
$$S = \{ g_1 N_G(H), ~g_2 N_G(H), ~\cdots, ~g_k N_G(H) \}.$$

where each $g_i$ is a distinct element of $G$ yielding a distinct coset
$g_i N_G(H)$. In particular, if $i\neq j$, then $g_i \neq g_j$, and
$g_i N_G(H) \not \in g_j N_G(H)$.

In particular, $S$ acts on $C_H$, $$\begin{aligned}
S &\curvearrowright C_H \\
g_i N_G(H) &\curvearrowright H = g_i H g_i^{-1},\end{aligned}$$

taking $H$ to one of its conjugate subgroups.

So define $$K \coloneqq 
\{ g_i H g_i^{-1} \mid 1 \leq i \leq k \}.$$

Note that $K \subseteq C_H$, and has at most $k$ elements.

We claim that $K$ has $k$ *distinct* elements, i.e. that each $g_{i}$
takes $H$ to a *distinct* conjugate subgroup. We have $$\begin{aligned}
g_{i} H g^{-1}_{i} 
    &= g_{j} H g^{-1}_{j} &\implies \\
g_j^{-1} g_{i} H g^{-1}_{i} g_j 
    &= H &\implies \\
(g_j^{-1} g_{i}) H (g_j^{-1} g_{i})^{-1} 
    &= H &\implies \\
g_j^{-1} g_{i} &\in N_G(H) &\implies \\
g_i &\in g_j N_G(H) &\implies \\
g_i &= g_j,\end{aligned}$$

where the last line follows because we assumed that each coset contains
at most one $g_i$.

Thus $K$ has $k$ distinct elements, and so
$$= k = |K| \leq |C_H| = n_H.$$

We now claim that $k \geq n_H$ as well.

Let $H' \in C_H$ be any subgroup conjugate to $H$, so $H' = gHg^{-1}$
for some $g\in G$. Then $g = g_i$ for some $i$, so $g \in g_{i} N_G(H)$.

Thus $g = g_{i} n$ for some $n\in N_G(H)$, but
$n\in N_G(H) \iff nHn^{-1} = H$ by definition, and so we have
$$\begin{aligned}
    H' 
    &= gHg^{-1} \\
    &= (g_i n) H (g_i n)^{-1} \\
    &= g_i (n H n^{-1}) g_i^{-1} \\
    &= g_i H g_i^{-1} \in K.\end{aligned}$$

Since $H' \in C_H$ was an arbitrary subgroup conjugate to $H$, this says
that $C_H \subseteq K$ and thus $$n_H = |C_H| \leq |K| = k$$

Thus $$[G: N_G(H)] = k = |M| = |K| = n_H,$$ which is what we wanted to
show. ◻

:::

:::{.solution}


:::{.claim title="1"}
Conjugacy classes in $S_n$ are completely
determined by cycle type.
:::

This follows because of the result on homework 1, which says that for
any two cycles $\tau,\sigma\in S_n$, we have
$$\tau(s_1~s_2~\cdots~s_k)\tau^{-1} = (\tau(s^1)~\tau(s^2)~\cdots~\tau(s_k)).$$

In particular, this shows that the cycle type of a single cycle is
invariant under conjugation. If an element $\sigma \in S_n$ is comprised
of multiple cycles, say $\sigma = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_\ell$, then
$$\tau(\sigma)\tau^{-1} = \tau(\sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_\ell)\tau^{-1} 
= (\tau\sigma_1\tau^{-1})\cdots(\tau\sigma_\ell\tau^{-1}),$$

which shows that the entire cycle type is preserved under conjugation.
So each conjugacy class has exactly one cycle type, and distinct classes
have distinct cycle types, so this completely determines the conjugacy
classes.

**Claim 2:** Cycle types in $S_n$ are in bijective correspondence with
integer partitions of $n$.

This follows because any integer partition of $n$ can be used to obtain
a canonical representative of a conjugacy class of $S_n$: if
$n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots a_n$, we simply take a cycle of length $a_1$ the
first $a_1$ integers in order, a cycle of length $a_2$ containing the
integers $a_1 + 1$ to $a_2$ in order, and so on.

Conversely, any permutation can be written as a product of disjoint
cycles, and when the cycles for fixed points are added in, every integer
between 1 and $n$ will appear, and the sum of the lengths of all cycles
must sum to $n$. Thus taking the cycle lengths yields an integer
partition of $n$.

All integer partitions of 5 are given below, along with a canonical
representative of the associated conjugacy class. $$\begin{aligned}
    5 && (1~2~3~4~5) \\
    4 + 1 && (1~2~3~4)(5) \\

1.  Show that a system of linear equations 
  \[
  a_{11} x_{1}+a_{12} x_{2} + &\cdots + a_{1 m} x_{m}=b_{1} \\ 
  & \vdots \\ 
  a_{n 1} x_{1}+a_{n 2} x_{2}+&\cdots+a_{n m} x_{m}=b_{n}
  \]
  has a simultaneous solution $\iff$ the corresponding matrix equation
  $AX = B$ has a solution, where
  $A = (a_{ij}), X = [x_1, \cdots, x_m]^t$, and
  $B = [b_1, \cdots , b_n]^t$.

2.  If $A_1, B_1$ are matrices obtained from $A, B$ respectively by
  performing the same sequence of elementary **row** operations, then
  $X$ is a solution of $AX=B$ $\iff$ $X$ is a solution of
  $A_1 X = B_1$.

3.  Let $C$ be the $n \times (m+1)$ matrix given by
\[
C = \left(\begin{array}{llll}{a_{11}} & {\cdots} & {a_{1 m}} & {b_{1}} \\ {} & {} & {} \\ {\cdot} & {} & {} \\ {a_{n 1}} & {\cdots} & {a_{n m}} & {b_{n}}\end{array}\right)
.\]
  Then $AX = B$ has a solution $\iff$
  $\mathrm{rank} A = \mathrm{rank} C$ and the solution is unique
  $\iff \mathrm{rank}(A) = m$.

  >Hint: use part 2.

4.  If $B=0$, so the system $AX=B$ is homogeneous, then it has a
    nontrivial solution $\iff \mathrm{rank} A < m$ and in particular
    $n<m$.
