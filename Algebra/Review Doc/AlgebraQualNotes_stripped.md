::: {.remark}
Adapted from remark written by Roy Smith, August 2006:

As a general rule, students are responsible for knowing both the theory (proofs) and practical applications (e.g. **how to find the Jordan or rational canonical form** of a given matrix, **or the Galois group of a given polynomial**) of the topics mentioned.

:::

::: {.remark}
For any \( p \) dividing the order of \( G \), \( \mathrm{Syl}_p(G) \) denotes the *set* of Sylow\( {\hbox{-}}p \) subgroups of \( G \).
:::

## Definitions

::: {.fact}
An set morphism that is *either* injective or surjective between sets of the same size is automatically a bijection. Consequently, a group morphism between groups of the same size that is either injective or surjective is automatically an isomorphism.
:::

::: {.fact title="The division algorithm"}
If \( a, b\in {\mathbb{Z}} \) with \( \gcd(a, b) = d \), then there exist \( s,t\in {\mathbb{Z}} \) such that
\[
as + bt = d
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
Useful context clue! In particular, this works when \( a, b \) are coprime and \( d=1 \). If you see "coprime" in a finite group question, try the division algorithm.
:::

::: {.definition title="Order"}
The **order** of an element \( g\in G \), denoted \( n \coloneqq o(g) \), is the smallest \( n\in {\mathbb{Z}}^{\geq 0} \) such that \( g^n = e \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group.
:::

::: {.definition title="Commutator"}
The **commutator subgroup** of \( G \) is denoted \( [G, G] \leq G \). It is the subgroup generated by all elementary commutators:
\[
[G, G] \coloneqq\left\langle{ aba^{-1}b^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}a, b\in G }\right\rangle 
.\]

It is the smallest normal subgroup \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) such that \( G/N \) is abelian, so if \( H\leq G \) and \( G/H \) is abelian, \( H\subseteq [G, G] \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Group Presentation"}
An expression of the form \( G = \left\langle{S {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}R}\right\rangle \) where \( S \) is a set of elements and \( R \) a set of words defining relations means that \( G \coloneqq F[S] / { \operatorname{cl}} _n(R) \) where \( F[S] \) is the free group on the set \( S \) and \( { \operatorname{cl}} _n(R) \) is the normal closure, the smallest normal subgroup of \( F[S] \) containing \( R \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Finding morphisms between presentations: if \( G \) is presented with generators \( g_i \) with relations \( r_i \) and \( H \) is any group containing elements \( h_i \) also satisfying \( r_i \), there is a group morphism
\[
\phi: G &\to H \\
g_i &\mapsto h_i \quad \forall i
.\]
Why this exists: the presentation yields a morphism \( \pi: F(g_i) \to G \) with \( G\cong F(g_i) / \ker \pi \). Define a map \( \psi: F(g_i) \to H \) where \( g_i\mapsto h_i \), then since the \( h_i \) satisfy the relations \( r_i \), \( \ker \pi \subseteq \ker \psi \). So \( \psi \) factors through \( \ker \pi \) yielding a morphism \( F/\ker \pi \to H \).
:::

## Subgroups

::: {.definition title="Subgroup"}
A subset \( H\subseteq G \) is a **subgroup** iff

1.  Closure: \( HH \subset H \)
2.  Identity: \( e\in H \)
3.  Inverses: \( g\in H \iff g^{-1}\in H \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="Unions of subgroups"}
Show that if \( K, H\leq G \) are subgroups, then their union \( H \cup K \) is a subgroup iff (wlog) \( H \subset K \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Subgroup Generated by a Subset"}
If \( H\subset G \), then \( \left\langle{H}\right\rangle \) is the smallest subgroup containing \( H \):
\[
\left\langle{H}\right\rangle = \cap\left\{{H{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}H\subseteq M \leq G}\right\} M = \left\{{ h_1^{\pm 1} \cdots h_n^{\pm 1} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}n\geq 0, h_i \in H}\right\}
\]
where adjacent \( h_i \) are distinct.
:::

::: {.proposition title="One-step subgroup test"}
If \( H \subseteq G \) and \( a,b\in H \implies ab^{-1}\in H \), then \( H\leq G \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of the one-step subgroup test"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Identity: \( a=b=x\implies xx^{-1}=e\in H \)
-   Inverses: \( a=e, b=x \implies x^{-1}\in H \).
-   Closure: let \( x, y\in H \), then \( y^{-1}\in H \) by above, so \( xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1}\in H \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="Coprime order implies disjoint"}
Show that coprime order subgroups are disjoint, or more generally \( {\mathbb{Z}}_p, {\mathbb{Z}}_q \subset G \implies {\mathbb{Z}}_p \cap{\mathbb{Z}}_q = {\mathbb{Z}}_{(p,q)} \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Intersection of subgroups is a subgroup"}
If \( H, K\leq G \) then \( J \coloneqq H \cap K \leq G \) is a subgroup. Moreover \( J\leq H \) and \( J \leq K \).
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
One-step subgroup test.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Show that the intersection of two subgroups is again a subgroup.
-   Show that the intersection of two subgroups with coprime orders is trivial.
-   Show that subgroups with the *same* prime order are either equal or intersect trivially.
-   Give a counterexample where \( H,K\leq G \) but \( HK \) is not a subgroup of \( G \).
-   Show that \( G=H\times K \) iff the conditions for recognizing direct products hold.
:::

## Conjugacy

::: {.definition title="Conjugacy class"}
The **conjugacy class** of \( h \) is defined as
\[
C(h) \coloneqq\left\{{ ghg^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}g\in G }\right\} 
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
\( [e] = \left\{{ e }\right\} \) is always in a conjugacy class of size one -- this is useful for counting and divisibility arguments. Conjugacy classes are **not** subgroups in general, since they don't generally contain \( e \). However, by orbit-stabilizer and the conjugation action, their sizes always divide the order of \( G \).\

Also note that\( [x] = \left\{{ x }\right\} \iff x\in Z(G) \), i.e. having a trivial conjugacy class is the same as being central.
:::

::: {.definition title="Conjugate subgroups"}
Two subgroups \( H, K \leq G \) are **conjugate** iff there exists some \( g\in G \) such that \( gHg^{-1}= K \). Note that all conjugates have the same cardinality.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that the size of a conjugacy class divides the order of a group.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that if \( H < G \) is a proper subgroup, then \( \displaystyle\bigcup_{g\in G} gHg^{-1}\subset G \) is a proper subset.

> Hint: consider the intersection and count. Try Orbit-stabilizer?
:::

::: {.solution}
Strategy: bound the cardinality. All conjugates of \( H \) have the same cardinality, say \( \# H = m \). Suppose there are \( n \) distinct conjugates of \( H \). Then they intersect only at the identity, so count their elements:
\[
\# \displaystyle\bigcup_{g\in G} gHg^{-1}= 1 + n(m-1)
.\]
Use that \( n = [G: N_G(H)] \) by Orbit-Stabilizer, and \( N_G(H) \leq G \implies n \leq n' \coloneqq[G:H] \). Now note \( n'm = \# H[G:H] = \# G \) by Lagrange:
\[
\# \displaystyle\bigcup_{g\in G} gHg^{-1}
&= 1 + n(m-1) \\
&\leq 1 + n'(m-1) \\
&= 1 + n'm -n' \\
&= 1 + \# G - n' \\
&= \# G - (n' - 1) \\
&< \# G && \iff n' \coloneqq[G:H] > 1
.\]
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that normal groups absorb conjugacy classes: if \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) and \( [g_i] \) is a conjugacy class in \( g \), either \( [g_i] \subseteq N \) or \( [g_i] \cap N = \emptyset \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Prove that the size of a conjugacy class of \( g_i \) is the index of its centralizer, \( [G: Z(g_i)] \coloneqq[G: C_G(g_i)] \).
:::

### Normal Subgroups

::: {.definition title="Normal subgroup"}
A subgroup \( N\leq G \) is **normal** iff \( gH = Hg \) for every \( g\in G \), or equivalently \( gHg^{-1}= H \) for all \( g \), so \( H \) has only itself as a conjugate. We denote this by \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \). Equivalently, for every inner automorphism \( \psi \in \mathop{\mathrm{Inn}}(G) \), \( \psi(N) = N \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Normal iff disjoint union of conjugacy classes"}
\( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \iff N = {\textstyle\coprod}' [h_i] \) is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes, where the index set for this union is one \( h_i \) from each conjugacy class.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
Note that \( C(h_i) = \left\{{ gh_i g^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}g\in G }\right\} \), and \( gh_i g^{-1}\in H \) since \( H \) is normal, so \( C(h_i) \subseteq G \) for all \( i \). Conversely, if \( C(h_i) \subseteq H \) for all \( h_i \in H \), then \( gh_ig^{-1}\in H \) for all \( i \) and \( H \) is normal.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
-   Show that if \( H, K {~\trianglelefteq~}G \) and \( H\cap K = \emptyset \), then \( hk=kh \) for all \( h\in H,k\in K \).
-   Show that if \( H,K{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) are normal subgroups that intersect trivially, then \( [H, K] = 1 \) (so \( hk = kh \) for all \( k \) and \( h \)).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Prove that if \( G \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group, every subgroup \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) intersects the center \( Z(G) \).
:::

## Centralizing and Centers

::: {.definition title="Centralizer"}
The centralizer of an en element is defined as
\[
Z(h) \coloneqq C_G(h) \coloneqq\left\{{ g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}ghg^{-1}= h }\right\} 
,\]
the elements of \( G \) the stabilize \( h \) under conjugation.

The **centralizer of a subset** \( H \) is defined as
\[
Z(H) \coloneqq C_G(H) \coloneqq\displaystyle\bigcap_{h\in H} C_G(h) \coloneqq\left\{{g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}ghg^{-1}= h ~\forall h\in H}\right\}
,\]
the elements of \( G \) that simultaneously stabilize all of \( H \) pointwise under conjugation.
:::

::: {.definition title="Normalizer"}
\[
N_G(H) = \left\{{g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}gHg^{-1}= H}\right\} = \cup\left\{{H{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}H {~\trianglelefteq~}M \leq G}\right\} M
\]
Contrast to the centralizer: these don't have to fix \( H \) pointwise, but instead can permute elements of \( H \).
:::

::: {.remark}
\( C_G(S) {~\trianglelefteq~}N_G(H) \) for any \( H \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="NC Theorem"}
\( N_G(H) / C_G(H) \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(H) \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Normalizers Grow"}
If for every proper \( H<G \), \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}N_G(H) \) is again proper, then "normalizers grow" in \( G \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Center"}
\[
Z(G) = \left\{{ g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}[g, h] = e \, \forall h\in H}\right\}
= \left\{{ g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}Z(g) = G }\right\} 
,\]
the subgroup of *central* elements: those \( g\in G \) that commute with every element of \( G \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Show that if \( G/Z(G) \) is cyclic then \( G \) is abelian.
-   Show that \( G/N \) is abelian iff \( [G, G] \leq N \).
-   Show that every normal subgroup of \( G \) is contained in \( Z(G) \).
:::

## Cosets

::: {.proposition title="Tower law for subgroups"}
\[
K\leq H \leq G \implies [G: K] = [G:H] [H: K]
.\]
:::

::: {.proposition title="Indices grow"}
If \( H, K \leq G \), then
\[
[H: H \cap K ]\leq [G: K] 
.\]
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
Write \( G/H \cap K \coloneqq G/J = \left\{{ h_1J, \cdots, h_m J }\right\} \) as distinct cosets. Then \( i\neq j\implies h_i h_j^{-1}\not \in H \cap K \), but \( h_i h_j^{-1}\in H \) since \( H\leq G \), which forces \( h_i h_j^{-1}\not\in K \). So \( h_i K \neq h_j K \), meaning there are at least \( m \) cosets in \( G/K \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Cosets are identical or disjoint"}
Any two cosets \( xH, yH \) are either identical or disjoint.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
Note \( x\in xH \), since \( e\in H \) because \( H \) is a subgroup and we can take \( h=e \) to get \( x = xe \coloneqq xh \in xH \). The reverse containment is clear, so \( G = \cup_{x\in G} xH \) is a union of its cosets. Suppose toward a contradiction that \( \ell \in xH \cap yH \) we'll show \( xH = yH \). Write \( \ell =xh_1 =yh_2 \) for some \( h_i \), then
\[
xh_1 = yh_2 &\implies x = yh_2 h_1^{-1}\\
xh_3\in xH &\implies xh_3 = (yh_2h_1^{-1}) h_3 \in yH
,\]
so \( xH \subseteq yH \). A symmetric argument shows \( y_H \subseteq xH \). [^1]

## Counting Theorems

\[H \leq G \implies \# H \divides \# G.\]
Moreover, there is an equality \( [G:H] = \# G/ \# H \) when \( G \) is finite.
:::

::: {.proof title="of Lagrange's theorem"}
Write \( G/H = \left\{{g_0 H, g_1 H, \cdots, g_N H}\right\} \) for some \( N \coloneqq[G:H] \). Since cosets are equal or disjoint and have equal cardinality,
\[
G = {\textstyle\coprod}_{k \leq N} g_k H \implies \#G = \sum_{k\leq N} \# \qty{g_k H} = \sum_{k\leq N} \# H = N \# H
,\]
so \( \# G = N \# H \), \( \#H \) divides \( \# G \) and \( N = [G:H] \) divides \( \# G \).
:::

::: {.corollary title="?"}
\[
\# G = \#(G/H) \#H \coloneqq[G:H] \, \# H
,\]
or written another way,
\[
\#(G/H) = \# G/ \# H
.\]
:::

::: {.corollary}
The order of every element divides the size of \( G \), i.e.
\[
g\in G \implies o(g) \divides o(G) \implies g^{{\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert}} = e
.\]
:::

::: {.warnings}
There do **not** necessarily exist \( H \leq G \) with \( {\left\lvert {H} \right\rvert} = n \) for every \( n \divides {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} \). Counterexample: take \( G = A_5 \), then \( \# G = 5!/2 = 60 \) but \( G \) has no subgroup of order \( 30 \). If it did, this would be index 2 and thus normal, but \( A_{n\geq 5} \) is simple.

Another direct counterexample: \( {\left\lvert {A_4} \right\rvert} = 12 \) but has no subgroup of order 6. If such an \( H \) existed, it can't contain every 3-cycle, since \( A_4 \) is generated by 3-cycles. For \( x \) any 3-cycle *not* in \( H \), use that \( \# A_4/H = 2 \) and consider \( H, xH, x^2H \). \( x\not\in H \), so \( H\neq xH \), but two must be equal:

-   \( x^2H = H \): use \( x^2 = x^{-1} \) since \( x^3=e \), but \( x\in H \implies x^{-1}\in H \), \( \contradiction \)
-   \( xH = x^2H \): the fundamental theorem of cosets forces \( x^{-1}x^2 \in H \), so \( x\in H \). \( \contradiction \)

### The Class Equation and Burnside's Lemma

::: {.example title="Conjugation yields centers/centralizers"}
Let \( G \) act on *itself* by conjugation.

-   The orbit \( {\mathcal{O}}(g) = C(g) \) is the **conjugacy class** of \( x \).
    -   Thus the action is transitive iff there is one conjugacy class.
-   The set of fixed points \(  \mathrm{Fix} = Z(G) \) is the **center**.
-   The stabilizer is \( {\operatorname{Stab}}(g) = Z(g) = C_G(g) \), the **centralizer** of \( g \).
-   The kernel is the intersection of all centralizers, i.e. again the **center** \( Z(G) \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that \( [G: C_G(x_i)] \) is the number of elements in the conjugacy class of \( x_i \), and each \( x_i \in Z(G) \) has a singleton conjugacy class.
:::

::: {.remark}
Directly interpreting this using the orbit-stabilizer formula, the size of a conjugacy class \( C(x) \) is the index of its centralizer, \( [G: Z(x)] \), i.e.
\[
\# {C(x)} = [G: Z(x)]
.\]
Now note that \( G = {\textstyle\coprod}_k' {\mathrm{Orb}}(h_k) \) is a disjoint union of orbits (the prime denotes taking one representative from each orbit), and so
\[
G &= \displaystyle\coprod_k' {\mathrm{Orb}}(h_k) \xrightarrow{\sim} \displaystyle\coprod_k' G/{\operatorname{Stab}}(h_k) \\
\implies \# G &= \sum_{k}' \# C(h) = \sum_k' \#(G/{\operatorname{Stab}}(h_k)) = \sum_k' [G: Z(h_k)]
.\]
Pulling out the terms of size 1, we have \( [G: N_G(h_k)] = 1 \iff h_k \in Z(G) \), which yields the class equation:

If \( G \) is simple, \( H < G \) proper, and \( [G:H] = n \), then there exists an injective map \( \phi: G \hookrightarrow S_n \).

> Mnemonic: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points, i.e.
:::

::: {.proof title="of Burnside's Lemma"}
Strategy: form the set \( A \coloneqq\left\{{ (g,x) \in G\times X {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}g\curvearrowright x = x }\right\} \) and write/count it in two different ways. First union over \( G \):
\[
A = \displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} \left\{{ (g, x) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}gx = x }\right\} \cong \displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} \left\{{g}\right\}\times X^g
.\]

Then union over \( X \):
\[
A = \displaystyle\coprod_{x\in X} \left\{{ (g, x) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}gx= x }\right\} \cong \displaystyle\coprod_{x\in X} G_x \times\left\{{ g }\right\} 
.\]
Taking cardinalities, and using the fact that \( \left\{{p}\right\} \times A \cong A \) as sets for any set \( A \),
\[
\displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} X^g
\cong
\displaystyle\coprod_{x\in X} G_x
\implies 
\sum_{g\in G}\# X^g
=
\sum_{x\in X} \# G_x
.\]
Apply orbit-stabilizer:
\[
\# G_x = {\# G \over \# Gx} \implies
\sum_{g\in G} X^g
&= \sum_{x\in X} \# G_x \\
&= \sum_{x\in X} {\# G \over  \# Gx} \\
&= \# G\sum_{x\in X} {1 \over  \# Gx}
,\]
so it suffices to show \( \sum_{x\in X}{1\over \# Gx} = \# X/G \). Proceed by grouping terms in this sum according to which orbit they're in:
\[
\sum_{x\in X} {1\over \# Gx} 
&=
\sum_{Gx \in X/G} \sum_{y\in Gx} {1\over \# Gx} \\
&=
\sum_{Gx \in X/G} {1\over \# Gx} \sum_{y\in Gx} 1 \\
&=
\sum_{Gx \in X/G} {1\over \# Gx} \# G_x \\
&=
\sum_{Gx \in X/G} 1 \\
&= \# X/G

If \( G \) is a finite group and \( p\coloneqq[G:H] \) is the smallest prime dividing \( \# G \), then \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \).

-   Let \( \phi: G\curvearrowright X\coloneqq\left\{{xH}\right\} \), noting that \( \# X = p \) and \( \operatorname{Sym}(X) \cong S_p \).
-   Then \( K\coloneqq\ker \phi \subseteq H \).
-   Since \( G \) is finite and \( K\leq G \), we have \( [G:K] = \# (G/K) = \# G/ \# K \) so \( \# (G/K) \) divides \( \# G \).
-   Since \( G/K \cong K' \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \( S_p \), \( \# (G/K) \) divides \( \# S_p = p! \)
-   So \( \# (G/K) \) divides \( \gcd( \# G, p!) \), which is \( p \) since it was the minimal prime dividing \( \# G \).
-   \( p \) is prime, so if \( \# G/K\neq 1 \) we have \( \# G/K = p \).
-   Since \( K \subset H \) and \( [G:H] = p = [G: K] \), we have \( K = H \).
-   But \( K = \ker \phi {~\trianglelefteq~}G \), so \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \).

# Sylow Theorems

::: {.definition}
A **\( p{\hbox{-}} \)group** is a group \( G \) such that every element is order \( p^k \) for some \( k \). If \( G \) is a finite \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group, then \( {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} = p^j \) for some \( j \).

Write

-   \( {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} = p^k m \) where \( (p, m) = 1 \),
-   \( S_p \) a Sylow\( {\hbox{-}}p \) subgroup, and
-   \( n_p \) the number of Sylow\( {\hbox{-}}p \) subgroups.

## Sylow 1 (Cauchy for Prime Powers)

\[
\forall p^n \text{ dividing } {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} \text{, there exists a subgroup of size } p^n
.\]
:::

::: {.slogan}
Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroups exist for any \( p \) dividing \( {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} \), and are maximal in the sense that every \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup of \( G \) is contained in a Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup. If \( {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} = \prod p_i^{\alpha_i} \), then there exist subgroups of order \( p_i^{\beta_i} \) for every \( i \) and every \( 0 \leq \beta_i \leq \alpha_i \). In particular, Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroups always exist.

## Corollaries and Applications

:::

::: {.proposition}
Every \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup of \( G \) is contained in a Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup.
:::

::: {.proof}
Let \( H \leq G \) be a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup. If \( H \) is not *properly* contained in any other \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup, it is a Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup by definition. Otherwise, it is contained in some \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup \( H^1 \). Inductively this yields a chain \( H \subsetneq H^1 \subsetneq \cdots \), and by Zorn's lemma \( H\coloneqq\cup_i H^i \) is maximal and thus a Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup.

    -   Arrange the terms from lowest at the top to highest at the bottom. Push everything down so that the bottom-most rows are all filled out.

I'll use a shortcut for the table: instead of listing columns, I just list the prime powers for a single \( p \) in increasing order in the same cell. Then just always take the largest prime power in each cell at each stage:

  \( p = 2 \)   \( p= 3 \)   \( p =5 \)

  \( 2,2 \)     \( 3 \)      \( \emptyset \)

\( \implies n_{m-1} = 3 \cdot 2 \)

  \( p = 2 \)   \( p= 3 \)        \( p =5 \)
  ------------- ----------------- -----------------
  \( 2 \)       \( \emptyset \)   \( \emptyset \)

\( \implies n_{m-2} = 2 \)

and thus the invariant factor form is

\[
G \coloneqq{\mathbb{Z}}_2 \times {\mathbb{Z}}_2 \times {\mathbb{Z}}_{2^3} \times {\mathbb{Z}}_{5^2\cdot 7}

Make the table by factoring the order of each cyclic piece, being careful not to combine terms that come from distinct summands (e.g. not combining the two copies of \( 2^1 \)), and to keep exponents from factorizations intact as a single term (e.g. the \( 2^3 \)):

  \( 2 \)     \( 5 \)     \( 7 \)

Reading across rows from bottom to top (and using CRT to merge everything within a row) yields invariant factors on the LHS below. Reading down columns, left to right (merging nothing) yields elementary divisors on the RHS:

\[
{\mathbb{Z}}_2 \times {\mathbb{Z}}_2 \times {\mathbb{Z}}_{2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7}

Supposing that \( g\neq e \), it generates a cyclic subgroup \( H \coloneqq\left\langle{g}\right\rangle \leq G \) of order dividing \( p \) by Lagrange. Since \( g\neq e \), \( \#H = p = \# G \).

Every group \( G \) of order \( p^2 \) is abelian, and thus isomorphic to either \( {\mathbb{Z}}/p^2 \) or \( ({\mathbb{Z}}/p)^2 \).

Quotient by the center to get \( m\coloneqq\#G/Z(G) \in \left\{{ 1, p, p^2 }\right\} \)

::: {.proof title="of $pq$ theorem, case 1"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Suppose \( q<p \).
-   Apply the Sylow theorems to \( p \):
    -   \( n_p \cong 1 \pmod p \implies n_p \in \left\{{ 1, p+1, 2p+1, \cdots }\right\} \).
    -   \( n_p \divides q \implies n_p \in \left\{{ 1, q }\right\} \).
    -   Since \( 1<q<p<p+1 \), this forces \( n_p = 1 \)
-   Suppose \( q\notdivides p-1 \) and apply the Sylow theorems to \( q \):
    -   \( n_q \equiv 1\pmod q \implies n_q \in \left\{{ 1, q+1, 2q+1,\cdots }\right\} \)
    -   \( n_q \divides p \implies n_q\in \left\{{ 1, p }\right\} \)
    -   Now note that if \( n_q\neq 1 \), then \( n_q=p \) and \( p \) is of the form \( kq+1 \) for some \( k \).
    -   **Use of assumption**: then \( p=kq+1 \iff p-1 = kq \iff q\divides p-1 \), which is precisely what we assumed is *not* the case.
-   So \( n_p = n_q = 1 \) and \( S_p, S_q {~\trianglelefteq~}G \).
-   Apply recognition of direct products:
    -   \( S_p, S_q \leq G \): check.
    -   \( S_p, S_q {~\trianglelefteq~}G \): check.
    -   \( S_p \cap S_q = \left\{{ e }\right\} \): check, because they are coprime order.
    -   \( S_p S_q = G \): follows from a counting argument:
        \[
        \# S_pS_q = {\# S_p \# S_q \over \# \qty{S_p \cap S_q}} = {pq \over 1} = \# G
        .\]
        If \( G \) is finite, then \( AB\leq G \) with \( \#AB = \#G \) implies \( AB = G \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of $pq$ theorem, case 2"}
-   Suppose \( q \divides p-1 \), the previous argument for \( S_p \) works, but the argument for \( S_q \) doesn't, so we get a semidirect product.
-   Work up to isomorphism:
    \[
    S_p \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/p = \left\langle{a{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}a^p}\right\rangle
    &{~\trianglelefteq~}G \\ \\
    S_q \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/q =\left\langle{b{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}b^q}\right\rangle
    &\leq G
    .\]
-   We have
    \[
    G&\cong {\mathbb{Z}}/q \rtimes_{\psi} {\mathbb{Z}}/p
    && \psi: {\mathbb{Z}}/q \to \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}\qty{{\mathbb{Z}}/p} \\ \\
    \implies G &\cong\left\langle{a,b {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}a^p, b^q,\,\, aba^{-1}= \psi(b) = b^\ell }\right\rangle && \text{for some }\ell
    .\]
    -   Since \( {\mathbb{Z}}/q \) is cyclic, such a morphism is determined by the image of the generator \( [1]_q \in {\mathbb{Z}}/q \).
    -   Note that \( [1]_q \mapsto \operatorname{id}_{{\mathbb{Z}}/p} \) is such a morphism, and yields the direct product again.
-   Identify \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}({\mathbb{Z}}/p) \cong \qty{\qty{{\mathbb{Z}}/p}^{\times}, \times } \cong \qty{ {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1), +} \).
-   So we need to classify morphisms
    \[
    \psi: {\mathbb{Z}}/q\to {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1)
    .\]
    -   Consider \( \operatorname{im}\psi \leq {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1) \).
    -   Sending \( [1]_q \) to the identity in \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}({\mathbb{Z}}/p) \) yields the direct product again, so pick nontrivial morphisms.
    -   Since \( \# \operatorname{im}\psi \divides q \) which is prime, its order is equal to \( q \).
    -   Since \( q\divides p-1 \) and \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1) \) is cyclic of order \( p-1 \), by Cauchy's theorem there is a unique subgroup of order \( q \), say \( C_q \leq {\mathbb{Z}}(p-1) \)
    -   We can send \( [1]_q \) to \( [\alpha]_{p-1} \in {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1) \) where \( \alpha \) is any generator of \( C_q \), of which there are \( \phi(q) = q-1 \) nontrivial choices.
-   Thus there are \( q-1 \) distinct nontrivial choices for the action \( \psi: {\mathbb{Z}}/q \to {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1) \).

::: {.claim}
All choices yield isomorphic semidirect products.
:::

-   Use that \( G\coloneqq A\rtimes_{\psi} N \) with \( \psi:A\to \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(N) \) is an \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(N) \) and \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(A) \) module, where \( f \in \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(N) \) and \( \pi\in \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(A) \) act in the following ways:
    \[
    \pi &\curvearrowright A\rtimes_\psi N = A \rtimes_{\psi \circ \pi } N \\
    f &\curvearrowright A\rtimes_\psi N = A \rtimes_{\gamma_f \circ \psi } N
    .\]
    where
    \[
    \gamma_f: \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(N) &\to \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(N) \\
    \psi &\mapsto f\circ \psi \circ f^{-1}
    .\]
    -   These actions preserve the group isomorphism type of \( G \)
-   However, since \( C_q \leq {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1) \) and \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(C_q) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(q-1) \), there are exactly \( q-1 \) automorphisms of the image \( C_q \), say \( \left\{{\pi_k}\right\}_{k=1}^{q-1} \).
-   So \( \psi \circ \pi_k: {\mathbb{Z}}/q \to {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1) \) for \( 1\leq k \leq q-1 \) yields \( q-1 \) distinct actions, and we're done.

More traditionally stated:

::: {.proposition title="Third Isomorphism Theorem"}

where \( \phi: R\to R/I \) is the canonical quotient morphism.

More traditionally:

-   If \( S, I \in \operatorname{Id}(R) \) with \( S \) containing \( I \) then
    \[
    S/I \leq R/I

-   Every ideal in \( \operatorname{Id}(R/I) \) is of the form \( \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muS\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \coloneqq S/I \) for some \( S\in \operatorname{Id}(R) \) containing \( I \).

-   If \( I, J \in \operatorname{Id}(R) \) with \( I \subseteq J \subseteq R \) then there is an isomorphism
    \[
    {R/I \over J/I} {\xrightarrow{\sim}}{R\over J}

Since \( {\mathfrak{p}} \) is prime and \( x\neq 0 \implies a\not\in{\mathfrak{p}} \), so \( b\in {\mathfrak{p}} \). But then

Write \( P \) as the intersection of all prime ideals of \( R \).

\( {\sqrt{0_{R}} }^c \subseteq P^c \): Fix \( f \) non-nilpotent, we want to show \( f \) is not in any prime ideal. set \( S \subseteq R \) to be all ideals \( I \) such that \( f^{>0} \not \in I \). Apply Zorn's lemma: \( S\neq \emptyset \) since \( 0\in S \), so after ordering \( I \) by inclusions \( S \) contains a maximal \( {\mathfrak{p}} \) which we claim is prime. If \( a,b \in {\mathfrak{p}}^c \) then \( {\mathfrak{p}}+ \left\langle{ a }\right\rangle \) and \( {\mathfrak{p}}+ \left\langle{b}\right\rangle supset {\mathfrak{p}} \) strictly, and by maximality they aren't in \( S \).

## Zorn's Lemma

::: {.definition title="Chain in a poset"}
In a poset, a **chain** is a totally ordered subset. An **upper bound** on a subset \( S \) of a poset \( X \) is any \( x\in X \) such that \( s\leq x \) for all \( s\in S \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="Zorn's Lemma"}
If \( P \) is a poset in which every chain has an upper bound, then \( P \) has a maximal element.
:::

::: {.remark}
You can always form a subset poset, and restrict with any sub-collection thereof with a set predicate. To use Zorn's lemma, you need to take an arbitrary chain in your poset \( X \), produce an upper bound \( U \) (e.g. by taking a union), and showing that \( U \) is still in \( X \) (i.e. it still satisfies the right predicate).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Existence of maximal ideals"}
Every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.
:::

::: {.proof}
Let \( 0 < I < R \) be a proper ideal, and consider the set
\[
S = \left\{{J {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}I   \subseteq J < R}\right\}
.\]

Note \( I\in S \), so \( S \) is nonempty. The claim is that \( S \) contains a maximal element \( M \).

\( S \) is a poset, ordered by set inclusion, so if we can show that every chain has an upper bound, we can apply Zorn's lemma to produce \( M \).

Let \( C \subseteq S \) be a chain in \( S \), so \( C = \left\{{C_1 \subseteq C_2 \subseteq \cdots}\right\} \) and define \( \widehat{C} = \cup_i C_i \).

**\( \widehat{C} \) is an upper bound for \( C \):** This follows because every \( C_i \subseteq \widehat{C} \).

**\( \widehat{C} \) is in \( S \):** Use the fact that \( I \subseteq C_i < R \) for every \( C_i \) and since no \( C_i \) contains a unit, \( \widehat{C} \) doesn't contain a unit, and is thus proper.

L^H \coloneqq\left\{{ \ell \in L {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\sigma(l) = \ell }\right\}
.\]

:::

::: {.definition title="Field Automorphisms"}
\[ 
\mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(L/k) = \left\{{\sigma: L \to L {~\mathrel{\Big|}~} {\left.{{\sigma}} \right|_{{k}} }  = \operatorname{id}_k}\right\}
.\]
:::

::: {.definition title="Embeddings and Lifts"}
Let \( k \) denote a field, and \( L/k \) extension. Every field morphism is an embedding (injection). An **embedding** of \( k{\hbox{-}} \)algebras \( L\hookrightarrow L' \) will refer to any ring morphism over \( k \), i.e. a field morphism that restricts to the identity on \( k \):

More generally, we can ask for lifts of any map \( \sigma: k\to k' \):

Most often, we'll take \( \sigma: k\to k \) to be the identity.
:::

::: {.definition title="Perfect Fields"}
The following are equivalent:

-   \( k \) is a **perfect** field.

-   If \( \operatorname{ch}k > 0 \), the Frobenius is an automorphism of \( k \), so \( k^p = k \).

-   Every finite extension \( F/k \) is separable.

-   Every irreducible polynomial \( p\in k[x] \) is separable.
:::

::: {.example title="of a non-perfect field"}
Example of a non-perfect field: \( {\mathbb{F}}_p(t) \). Use that \( f(x) \coloneqq x^p - t \) is irreducible in \( {\mathbb{F}}_p(t)[x] \) but not separable.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Characterization of perfect fields"}
\( k \) is perfect (using the irreducible implies separable condition) if either

-   \( \operatorname{ch}k = 0 \) or
-   \( \operatorname{ch}k = p > 0 \) and \( k^p = k \).
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
For \( \operatorname{ch}k = 0 \), use that irreducible implies separable.

For \( \operatorname{ch}k = p \), show that \( k_p\neq k \iff \) irreducible does *not* imply separable, so there exists an inseparable irreducible.

-   Supposing \( k^p\neq k \), choose \( a\in k \) not a \( p \)th power.

-   Note that \( f(x) \coloneqq x^p-a \) has only one root in \( \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muk\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \): in a splitting field, any root \( r \) satisfies \( r^p=a \), so
    \[
    x^p - a = x^p - r^p = (x-r)^p
    .\]

-   Note \( f \) is irreducible: its only possible divisors are \( (x-r)^m \) for \( m \leq p \). Expanding yields
    \[
    (x-r)^m = \sum_{k=0}^m {m\choose k} x^{m-k} (-r)^{k} = x^m + {m\choose 1} x^{m-1} (-r)^m + \cdots
    ,\]
    so the coefficient of \( x^{m-1} \) is \( -mr \in k \).

-   Thus if \( (x-r)^m \) has a nontrivial divisor in \( k[x] \) then \( m \) must be in \( k^{\times} \), forcing \( r\in k \). But then \( r^p = a\in k \), \( \contradiction \).
:::

::: {.remark title="Numerical Invariants"}
Let \( K/k \) be an extension.

\[
[K: k] = \dim_{{ \mathsf{Vect} }_k} K
\]
is the dimension of \( K \) as a \( k{\hbox{-}} \)vector space. Automorphisms of fields over \( K \) are defined as

\[ 
\mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}_{{ \mathsf{Fields}_{k} }}(K) \coloneqq\mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(K/k) \coloneqq\left\{{ \sigma: K \to K' {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}{ \left.{{\sigma}} \right|_{{k}} } = \operatorname{id}_k }\right\} 
, \]
so lifts of the identity on \( k \), and
\[
\left\{{K:k}\right\} \coloneqq\# \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(K/k)
.\]

If \( K/k \) is finite, normal, and separable,
\[
{ \mathsf{Gal}} (K/k) \coloneqq\mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(K/k)
,\]
where in general
\[
\left\{{K: k}\right\} \leq [K: k]
\]
with equality when \( L/k \) is Galois.

::: {.example title="of distinguished classes"}
The following classes of extensions are distinguished:

-   Algebraic.
-   Finite.
-   Separable.
-   Purely inseparable.
-   Finitely generated.
-   Solvable.
:::

For \( L/F/k \): \( L/k \) normal/algebraic/Galois \( \implies L/F \) normal/algebraic/Galois.
:::

## Normal Extensions

::: {.definition title="Normal Field Extension"}
Let \( L/k \) be an extension. Then TFAE:

-   \( L/k \) is **normal**.

-   Every irreducible polynomial \( f\in k[x] \) that has one root in \( L \) has *all* of its roots in \( L \), and thus splits in \( L[x] \).

    -   So if \( \alpha\in L \) then every Galois conjugate \( \alpha_k \in L \) as well.. Thus either \( f \) splits in \( L \) or \( f \) has no roots in \( L \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Characterization of normal algebraic extensions"}
If \( L/k \) s algebraic, then \( L/k \) is normal iff every embedding \( \sigma: L \hookrightarrow\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muk\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \) lifting the identity on \( k \) satisfies \( \sigma(L) = L \), so \( \sigma \) is an automorphism of \( L \) fixing \( k \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Normal Closure"}
If \( K/k \) is algebraic, then there is an extension \( N_k/K \) such that \( N_k/k \) is normal and \( N_k/K/k \) is a tower.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Characterization of finite normal extensions as splitting fields"}
An extension \( L/k \) is finite and normal \( \iff L \) is the splitting field of some polynomial \( f\in k[x] \).
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
\( \implies \):

-   Write \( L = k(a_1, \cdots, a_n) \) by finiteness.
-   Let \( m_i \) be the minimal polynomials of the \( a_i \).
-   By normality, the \( m_i \) split in \( L[x] \).
-   Then \( L \) is the splitting field of \( f(x) \coloneqq\prod_i m_i(x) \).

\( \impliedby \):

-   Suppose \( L/k = \operatorname{SF}(f) \), and pick any monic \( m\in L[x]^{{\mathrm{irr}}} \) with a root \( a\in L \), so that \( m \) is the minimal polynomial of \( a \).

-   Toward showing \( m \) splits in \( L \): let \( M = \operatorname{SF}(m) \), we'll show \( M=L \).

-   To show that for any root \( b\in M \) we have \( b\in L \), it suffices to show \( [L(b): L] = 1 \).

    The strategy: use that \( [L(a):L] = 1 \) since \( a\in L \) by assumption, and try to relate the two degrees.

-   We have \( L/k \), and a number of towers to work with:
    \[
    [L(a):k] &= [L(a): k(a)] [k(a): k] &= [L(a) : L] [L: k] \\ \\
    [L(b):k] &= [L(b): k(b)] [k(b): k] &= [L(b) : L] [L: k]
    .\]

-   In the first set of equalities, note that \( k(a)_{/ {k}}  \cong k(b)_{/ {k}}  \) since \( a,b \) are conjugate roots over \( k \). Moreover \( L(a)_{/ {k(a)}}  \cong L(b) _{/ {k(b)}}  \) since both are splitting fields for \( f \).

-   Thus \( [L(a):k] = [L(b): k] \), which forces \( [L(a): L] = [L(b): L] \) after dividing by \( [L:k] \). But \( [L(a): L] = 1 \).
:::

::: {.example title="of normal extensions"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Useful trick: if \( [L: k] = 2 \) then \( L/k \) is automatically normal.

-   Useful trick: if \( L/K/k \), then \( K/k \) is normal iff \( { \mathsf{Gal}} (L/K) {~\trianglelefteq~}{ \mathsf{Gal}} (L/k) \).

-   \( K \coloneqq{\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1\over 3}) \) is not normal, since \( K\subset {\mathbb{R}} \) but \( (x^3-2) = \prod_k x-\zeta_3^k 2^{1\over 3} \) with \( \zeta_3, \zeta_3^2 \in {\mathbb{C}} \).

    -   Another reason: an embedding \( \sigma: K\to \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muk\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \) can send \( 2^{1\over 3} \) to any other root of \( x^3-2 \).

-   \( {\mathbb{Q}}(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3) \) is normal over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \), since it it is finite and splits \( f(x) \coloneqq(x^2-2)(x^2-3) \), which is a separable polynomial.

-   \( L \coloneqq{\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1\over 4}) \) is not normal, since it is finite but not the splitting field of any polynomial.

-   \( {\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_k) \) is normal for \( \zeta_k \) any primitive \( k \)th root of unity.

-   A normal non-separable extension: \( {\mathbb{F}}_p(x, y) _{/ {{\mathbb{F}}_p (x^p, y^p)}}  \). This has finite degree \( p^2 \) but infinitely many subfields?

### Issues with Normal Towers

::: {.warnings}
Normal extensions are *not* distinguished, since they fail the forward implication for (lower) transitivity. However, they do have the (forward implication) upper transitive, lifting, and compositing properties.
:::

::: {.example title="Normal extensions are not transitive: failure of lower transitivity, forward implication"}
One can similarly produce towers where the total extension is normal but the lower iterate is not normal: take
\[
L/K/k \coloneqq{\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1\over 3}, \zeta_3) / {\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1\over 3}) / {\mathbb{Q}}
.\]
Now \( K/k \) isn't normal, since \( { \mathsf{Gal}} (L/k) = S_3 \) but \( { \mathsf{Gal}} (L/K) = {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \not{~\trianglelefteq~}S_3 \).

Another example: let \( L/k \) be any algebraic extension that isn't normal, and take \( N_k \) to be the normal closure to get \( N_k/L \). Concretely, \( N_{\mathbb{Q}}/ {\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1\over 3})/{\mathbb{Q}} \) works.
:::

::: {.example title="Normal extensions are not transitive: failure of reverse implication"}
One can produce towers of successively normal extensions whose total extension is not normal in a cheap way: take
\[
L/K/k \coloneqq{\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1\over 4}) / {\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1\over 2}) / {\mathbb{Q}}
.\]
Each iterate is normal since it's quadratic, but the overall extension misses complex roots and is thus not normal.

-   Use the fact that for finite extensions, \( L/k \) is normal and separable \( \iff L \) is the splitting field of a separable polynomial \( f\in k[x] \).
-   Now regard \( f \) as a polynomial in \( K[x] \); then \( L \) is still the splitting field of \( f \) over \( K \), done.

Alternatively,

-   Let \( \alpha\in L \) be a root of \( f\in K[x] \) with \( f \) irreducible, it suffices to show all roots of \( f \) are in \( L \).
-   Let \( m\in K[x] \) be the minimal polynomial of \( \alpha \) over \( K \), and let \( m'\in k[x] \) be the minimal polynomial of \( \alpha \) over \( k \).
-   Since \( L/k \) is normal and \( \alpha\in L \), \( m' \) splits in \( L \).
-   Minimal polynomials are divisible in towers, so \( m \) divides \( m' \). Since \( m' \) splits in \( L \), so must \( m \).

Use the embedding characterization, it suffices to show that every embedding \$`\sigma`{=tex}: \$ Since \( k \subseteq K \), any embedding \( \sigma: K\hookrightarrow\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muk\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \) over \( \operatorname{id}_K \) is also an embedding over \( \operatorname{id}_k \). Since \( L/k \) is normal, \( \sigma(L) = L \) and \( L/K \) is thus normal.

## Separable Extensions

::: {.definition title="Separable polynomials"}
A polynomial \( f \in k[x] \) is **separable** iff \( f \) has no repeated roots.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Separability test: $\\gcd$ with derivative"}
\( f \) is separable iff \( \gcd(f, f')=1 \), so \( f, f' \) share no common roots. Moreover, the multiple roots of \( f \) are precisely the roots of \( \gcd(f, f') \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of separability test"}
\( \not\implies \): Suppose \( f \) has a repeated root \( r_i \), so its multiplicity is at least 2. Then
\[
f(x) = (x-r)^2 g(x) \implies f'(x) = 2(x-r)g(x) + (x-r)^2g'(x)
,\]
so \( r \) is a root of \( f' \).

\( \not\impliedby \): Suppose \( r \) is a root of \( f, f' \). Write \( f(x) = (x-r)p(x) \) and \( f'(x) = (x-r)p'(x) + p(x) \). Rearranging, \( f'(x) - (x-r)p'(x) = p(x) \), and since \( r \) is a root of the LHS it's a root of the RHS. So \( p(x) = (x-r) q(x) \) and \( f(x) = (x-r)^2 q(x) \), making \( r \) a repeated root.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Separability test: identically zero derivative"}
\( f\in k[x]^{{\mathrm{irr}}} \) is **inseparable** (so \( f \) has a repeated root) iff \( f'(x) \equiv 0 \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of separability test"}
Assume \( f \) is monic, then \( f \) is inseparable iff \( f, f' \) have a common root \( a \). So \( (x-a)\divides q\coloneqq\gcd(f, f') \), and since \( f \) is irreducible, it must be the minimal polynomial of \( a \). Since \( f'(a) = 0 \), this forces \( f'\divides f \), and since \( \deg f' = \deg f - 1 < \deg f \) this forces \( f' \equiv 0 \).
:::

::: {.example title="of separable and inseparable polynomials"}
```{=tex}

-   \( x^2-2 \) is separable over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \), but inseparable over \( {\mathbb{F}}_2 \).
-   \( (x^2-2)^2 \) is inseparable over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \)
-   \( x^2-t \) is inseparable over \( {\mathbb{F}}_2(t) \).
-   \( f(x) \coloneqq x^{p^n}-x \) is separable over \( {\mathbb{F}}_p \), since \( f'(x) = -1 \) has no roots at all.
-   \( f(x) \coloneqq x^n-1 \) is inseparable over \( {\mathbb{F}}_p \) when \( p\divides n \). Otherwise, \( f' = nx^{n-1} \) has only \( x=0 \) as roots, whereas \( 0 \) is not a root of \( f \), so \( f \) is separable.
-   If \( \operatorname{ch}k=0 \), then irreducible \( \implies \) separable.
:::

::: {.corollary title="Inseparable iff polynomial in characteristic powers"}
If \( f\in k[x]^{{\mathrm{irr}}} \) and \( p\coloneqq\operatorname{ch}k > 0 \), then \( f \) inseparable \( \iff f(x) = q(x^{p^n}) \) for some unique \( n \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of inseparable characterization"}
\( \implies \):

Use that \( f \) is inseparable iff \( f' \equiv 0 \). The claim is that \( f' \equiv 0 \) in characteristic \( p \) iff all exponents present in \( f \) are divisible by \( p \). If \( f'\equiv 0 \), write
\[
f(x) &= a_nx^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \\
\implies f'(x) &= na_nx^{n-1} + (n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1 \\
&\equiv 0
,\]
which forces \( i a_i = 0 \) for all \( i \). For any \( a_i\neq 0 \), this forces \( i\equiv 0 \pmod p \), so \( a_i \) can only be nonzero when \( p\divides i \), so \( i=kp \) for some \( k \). So reindex to write
\[
f(x) = a_0 + a_1x^p + a_2x^{2p} + \cdots + a_n x^{np} = \qty{b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^{2} + \cdots + b_nx^{n}}^p \in \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muk\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu[x]
,\]
using \( (c+d)^p = c^p + d^p \) in characteristic \( p \), and taking \( b_i \coloneqq a_i^{1\over p} \in \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muk\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \) So \( f' \equiv 0\implies f(x) = q(x^p) \) where \( q(t) \coloneqq\sum b_i t^i \).

\( \impliedby \): If \( f(x) = q(x^p) \) for some \( q \), the previous calculation shows \( q \) has multiple roots, thus so does \( f \), so \( f \) is inseparable.

If \( \operatorname{ch}k = p>0 \), then if \( f \) is irreducible and inseparable then \( f(x) = g(x^p) \) for some \( g \). Write \( g(x) = \sum a_k x^k \), and since \( k \) is perfect, write \( b_k \coloneqq a_k^{1\over p} \), then

If \( K/F \) and \( [K:F] = n \), then pick any \( \alpha \in K \) and consider \( 1, \alpha , \alpha ^2, ... \). This yields \( n+1 \) elements in an \( n{\hbox{-}} \)dimensional vector space, and thus there is a linear dependence

\( {\mathbb{GF}}(p^n) \) is the splitting field of \( \rho(x) = x^{p^n} - x \), and the elements are exactly the roots of \( \rho \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Splits Product of Irreducibles"}
Let \( \rho_n \coloneqq x^{p^n} - x \). Then \( f(x) \divides \rho_n(x) \iff \deg f \divides n \) and \( f \) is irreducible.
:::

::: {.corollary}
\( x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x) \) over all irreducible monic \( f_i \in {\mathbb{F}}_p[x] \) of degree \( d \) dividing \( n \).
:::

::: {.proof}
\( \impliedby \):

-   Suppose \( f \) is irreducible of degree \( d \).
-   Then \( f \divides x^{p^d} - x \), by considering \( F[x]/\left\langle{f}\right\rangle \).
-   Thus \( x^{p^d} - x \divides x^{p^n} - x \iff d\divides n \).

\( \implies \):

-   \( \alpha \in {\mathbb{GF}}(p^n) \iff \alpha^{p^n} - \alpha = 0 \), so every element is a root of \( \phi_n \) and \( \deg \min(\alpha, {\mathbb{F}}_p) \divides n \) since \( {\mathbb{F}}_p(\alpha) \) is an intermediate extension.

-   So if \( f \) is an irreducible factor of \( \phi_n \), \( f \) is the minimal polynomial of some root \( \alpha \) of \( \phi_n \), so \( \deg f \divides n \).

-   \( \phi_n'(x) = p^nx^{p^{n-1}} \neq 0 \), so \( \phi_n \) is squarefree and thus has no repeated factors. So \( \phi_n \) is the product of all such irreducible \( f \).

## Exercises

Show
\[
x^\ell - 1 \divides x^m-1 \iff \ell\divides m
.\]
:::

::: {.solution}
\( \implies \) - Write \( m = \ell q + r \) with \( 0\leq r < \ell \). - Write
\[
p(x) = {x^m-1 \over x^\ell - 1}
= {x^{lq+r} -1 \over x^\ell - 1}
= x^r{x^{lq} - 1 \over x^\ell - 1} + {x^r - 1 \over x^\ell - 1}
= q(x) + {x^r-1 \over x^\ell - 1}
,\]
where \( p,q \) are polynomial by divisibility. - So the remaining ratio must be polynomial, but since \( r<\ell \) is strict this forces \( r=0 \). Thus \( \ell \divides m \).

\( \impliedby \):

-   Write \( m = \ell q + r \), then \( r=0 \) by divisibility.
-   Then \( x^m-1 = x^{\ell q} - 1 \coloneqq z^q-1 \) where \( z\coloneqq x^\ell \).
-   Use that \( z-1 \divides z^q - 1 \), so \( x^{\ell}-1 \divides x{\lq} -1 = x^m-1 \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that if \( f \in {\mathbb{F}}_p[x]^{{\mathrm{irr}}} \) is degree \( d \),
\[
f \divides x^{p^n}-x \iff d\divides n
.\]
:::

::: {.solution}
\( \impliedby \):

-   If \( d\divides n \), \( x^d-1 \divides x^n-1 \) by a previous exercise, and so \( p^d-1 \divides p^n-1 \).
-   So \( x^{p^d-1} \divides x^{p^n-1} \), now multiply through by \( x \).
-   Claim: \( f \divides x^{p^d-1} \), from which the result immediately follows.
-   For \( \alpha \) any root of \( f \), \( {\mathbb{F}}_p(\alpha) \) is a finite field of size \( p^d \) since \( [{\mathbb{F}}_p(\alpha):{\mathbb{F}}_p] = d \).
-   So \( {\mathbb{F}}_p(\alpha)\cong {\mathbb{GF}}(p^d) \), which is the splitting field of \( x^{p^d}-x \).
-   Thus \( \alpha \) is a root of \( x^{p^d}-x \). Iterating over all roots yields the divisibility statement.

\( \implies \):

-   If \( f\divides g_n(x) \coloneqq x^{p^n}-x \), then every root \( \alpha \) of \( f \) is a root of \( g_n \).
-   So \( {\mathbb{F}}_p(\alpha) \subseteq {\mathbb{GF}}(p^n) \).
-   The result follows from the computation
    \[
    n &= [{\mathbb{GF}}(p^n) : {\mathbb{F}}_p] \\
    &= [{\mathbb{GF}}(p^n) : {\mathbb{F}}_p(\alpha)] \cdot [{\mathbb{F}}_p(\alpha) : {\mathbb{F}}_p] \\

-   \( f(x) \coloneqq x^n-1 \) over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \): \( G = ({\mathbb{Z}}/n)^{\times} \)

-   \( f(x) \coloneqq x^3-x+1 \) over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \): \( G = S_3 \) since \( \Delta = -23 \) is squarefree in \( {\mathbb{Q}} \).

-   \( f(x) \coloneqq x^3-3x+1 \) over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \): \( G=A_3 \) since \( \Delta = 81 \).

-   \( f(x) \coloneqq x^4-2 \) over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \): \( G=D_4 \) since \( i\mapsto -i \) is order 2 and \( 2^{1\over 4}\mapsto i2^{1\over 4} \) is order 4, and this eliminates all other possibilities for groups of order 8.

-   Any irreducible \( f(x) \) of degree \( p \) prime with only two non-real roots: \( G = S_p \), since conjugation is a transposition and Galois acts transitively, so there is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)cycle, and these generate \( S_p \).

    -   Why? \( \alpha\in L \implies \min_{\alpha}(x) = (x- \alpha)g(x) \) which forces \( \deg(g) = 1 \).
-   So \( L \) is a splitting field.
-   If \( \operatorname{ch}(k) \neq 2 \), then
    \[
    {\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\,} \min_{ \alpha}(x) = 2x - \cdots \not\equiv 0

One can complete the square for quadratics:

## Classification of Modules over a PID

::: {.proposition title="STFGMPID"}
Let \( M \) be a finitely generated modules over a PID \( R \). Then there is an **invariant factor** decomposition

`\begin{align*}
M \cong F \bigoplus_{i=1}^m R/(r_i) \quad\text{where } r_1 \divides r_2 \divides \cdots
\end{align*}`{=tex}

and similarly an **elementary divisor** decomposition:
\[
M \cong F \bigoplus_{i=1}^n R/ \left\langle{p_i^{e_i}}\right\rangle
\]
where \( F \) is free of finite rank and the \( p_i \) are *not necessarily distinct* primes in \( R \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Principal Ideals are Free"}
If \( I {~\trianglelefteq~}R \) is an ideal of \( R \), then \( I \) is a free \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module iff \( I \) is a principal ideal.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
\( \implies \):

Suppose \( I \) is free as an \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module, and let \( B = \left\{{\mathbf{m}_j}\right\}_{j\in J} \subseteq I \) be a basis so we can write \( M = \left\langle{B}\right\rangle \). Suppose that \( {\left\lvert {B} \right\rvert} \geq 2 \), so we can pick at least 2 basis elements \( \mathbf{m}_1\neq \mathbf{m}_2 \), and consider
\[
\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{m}_1 \mathbf{m}_2 - \mathbf{m}_2 \mathbf{m}_1,
\]

which is also an element of \( M \) . Since \( R \) is an integral domain, \( R \) is commutative, and so
\[
\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{m}_1 \mathbf{m}_2 - \mathbf{m}_2 \mathbf{m}_1 = \mathbf{m}_1 \mathbf{m}_2 - \mathbf{m}_1 \mathbf{m}_2 = \mathbf{0}_M
\]

However, this exhibits a linear dependence between \( \mathbf{m}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{m}_2 \), namely that there exist \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \neq 0_R \) such that \( \alpha_1 \mathbf{m}_1 + \alpha_2 \mathbf{m}_2 = \mathbf{0}_M \); this follows because \( M \subset R \) means that we can take \( \alpha_1 = -m_2, \alpha_2 = m_1 \). This contradicts the assumption that \( B \) was a basis, so we must have \( {\left\lvert {B} \right\rvert} = 1 \) and so \( B = \left\{{\mathbf{m}}\right\} \) for some \( \mathbf{m} \in I \). But then \( M = \left\langle{B}\right\rangle = \left\langle{\mathbf{m}}\right\rangle \) is generated by a single element, so \( M \) is principal.

\( \impliedby \): Suppose \( M{~\trianglelefteq~}R \) is principal, so \( M = \left\langle{\mathbf{m}}\right\rangle \) for some \( \mathbf{m} \neq \mathbf{0}_M \in M \subset R \).

Then \( x\in M \implies x = \alpha\mathbf{m} \) for some element \( \alpha\in R \) and we just need to show that \( \alpha\mathbf{m} = \mathbf{0}_M \implies \alpha = 0_R \) in order for \( \left\{{\mathbf{m}}\right\} \) to be a basis for \( M \), making \( M \) a free \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module. But since \( M \subset R \), we have \( \alpha, m \in R \) and \( \mathbf{0}_M = 0_R \), and since \( R \) is an integral domain, we have \( \alpha m = 0_R \implies \alpha = 0_R \) or \( m = 0_R \). Since \( m \neq 0_R \), this forces \( \alpha = 0_R \), which allows \( \left\{{m}\right\} \) to be a linearly independent set and thus a basis for \( M \) as an \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module.

# Linear Algebra

Some definitions:

-   \( A^t \) is the usual transpose.
-   \( A^{\dagger} \) is the conjugate transpose.
-   A matrix is \( A^{\dagger} \) is **adjoint** to \( A \) iff \( {\left\langle {A\mathbf{x}},~{\mathbf{y}} \right\rangle} = {\left\langle {\mathbf{x}},~{A^{\dagger} \mathbf{y}} \right\rangle} \).
    -   \( A \) is **self-adjoint** iff \( A \) is an adjoint for itself, so \( {\left\langle {A\mathbf{x}},~{\mathbf{y}} \right\rangle} = {\left\langle {\mathbf{x}},~{A \mathbf{y}} \right\rangle} \).
-   \( A \) is **symmetric** iff \( A = A^t \).
    -   \( A \) is **orthogonal** iff \( A^tA = AA^t = I \)
-   \( A \) is **Hermitian** iff \( A^{\dagger} = A \).
    -   \( A \) is **normal** iff \( AA^{\dagger} = A^{\dagger} A \).
    -   \( A \) is **unitary** iff \( A^{\dagger}A = AA^{\dagger} = I \).
:::

::: {.fact title="Undergrad reminders"}
\[
\operatorname{det}M = \prod_{\sigma \in S_n} {\varepsilon}(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \sigma(i)}
.\]

For example,

\[
\operatorname{det}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{array}\right)=\begin{gathered}
a_{11} a_{22} a_{33}+a_{12} a_{23} a_{31}+a_{13} a_{21} a_{32} \\
-a_{13} a_{22} a_{31}-a_{12} a_{21} a_{33}-a_{11} a_{23} a_{32}
\end{gathered}
.\]

Let \( {\operatorname{minor}}_A(i, j) \) denote \( A \) with the \( i \)th row, \( j \)th column deleted.

One can expand determinants along rows:
\[
\operatorname{det}(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} \operatorname{det}{\operatorname{minor}}_A(i, j)
.\]

Also useful, a matrix can be inverted by computing the adjugate:
\[
A^{-1}= {1\over \operatorname{det}A} \operatorname{adj}(A) && \operatorname{adj}(A)_{ij} \coloneqq(-1)^{i+j} \operatorname{det}{\operatorname{minor}}_A(j, i)
.\]

The eigenvalues of an upper-triangular matrix are exactly the diagonal entries, and the determinant is their product. More generally, the determinant is always the product of the eigenvalues, and the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, so \( {\mathrm{tr}}(A) = \sum \lambda_i \) and \( \operatorname{det}(A) = \prod \lambda_i \).

Matrices can be block-multiplied when all dimensions are compatible:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
A & B \\
C & D 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
E & F \\
G & H 
\end{bmatrix}
= {
\begin{bmatrix}
  {AE + BG} & {AF + BH} 
\\
  {CE + DG} & { CF + DH}
\end{bmatrix}
}
.\]

> Note that if any of these matrix multiplications don't make sense, the results won't be valid!

If \( A \) is upper triangular, some entries of \( A^k \) can be computed easily:

\[
A\coloneqq\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_1 & & * \\
& \ddots & \\
0 & & a_n
\end{array}\right)
\implies
A^k = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_1^k & & * \\
& \ddots & \\
0 & & a_n^k
\end{array}\right)
.\]

Traces of products can be commuted: \( \operatorname{tr}(AB) = \operatorname{tr}(BA) \), so similar matrices have identical traces since \( \operatorname{tr}(PJP^{-1}) = \operatorname{tr}{PP^{-1}J} = \operatorname{tr}{J} \).

The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are elementary symmetric functions in the eigenvalues:
\[
\chi_A(t) = t^n - \qty{\sum_i \lambda_i }t^{n-1} + \qty{\sum_{i < j} \lambda_i \lambda_j }t^{n-2} + \cdots \pm \qty{\prod_i \lambda_i}
.\]
:::

::: {.proposition title="Useful computational trick"}
A trick for finding characteristic polynomials:
\[
\chi_A(t) &= \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \operatorname{tr}\qty{\bigwedge\nolimits^k A} t^{n-k} \\
&= t^n - \operatorname{tr}\qty{A} t^{n-1} + \operatorname{tr}\qty{\bigwedge\nolimits^2 A}t^{n-2} - \cdots \pm \operatorname{tr}\qty{\bigwedge\nolimits^{n-1} A} t \mp \operatorname{det}(A)
,\]
using that

\[
{\bigwedge\nolimits^0 A} \coloneqq 1 \\
{\bigwedge\nolimits^1 A} \coloneqq A \\
\operatorname{tr}\qty{\bigwedge\nolimits^n A} = \operatorname{det}(A)
.\]

Moreover, the intermediate traces are easy to compute by hand:
\[
\operatorname{tr}\qty{\bigwedge\nolimits^\ell A} = \sum \operatorname{det}\qty{M^{\ell}}
,\]
where the sum is taken over all \( \ell\times\ell \) **principal minors**: determinants of the \( n \choose \ell \) principal matrices which are obtained by choosing \( \ell \) diagonal entries to keep and and deleting the rows and columns for every entry not chosen. Equivalently, one can select \( n-\ell \) diagonal entries and delete the corresponding row/column for each.

:::

To factor this polynomial, the **rational roots test** can be useful: for \( f(t) = a_nt^n + \cdots + a_1 t + a_0 \), rational roots are of the form \( p/q \) where \( p \divides a_n \) and \( q\divides a_0 \). Note that this simplifies greatly for \( f \) monic! Once you have a root, apply **polynomial long division** to get a smaller problem, and hopefully this continues to work until it's factored.
:::

::: {.example title="of polynomial long division"}
Consider \( f(x) \coloneqq x^3-6x^2+12x-8 \), then any rational root is in \( \left\{{\pm 8, \pm 4, \pm 2, \pm 1}\right\} \). Testing \( f(2) = 0 \) works, and dividing by \( x-2 \) yields

![](figures/2021-07-24_18-32-38.png)

The rest can be factored by inspection:
\[
f(x) = (x-2)(x^2-4x+4) = (x-2)^3
.\]

Writing \( \operatorname{Ann}(\mathbf{v}) \) as the annihilator of \( \mathbf{v} \), a generalized eigenvector for the pair \( (\lambda_i, \mathbf{v}) \) for a matrix \( A \) is any operator in the space \( \sqrt{\operatorname{Ann}(\mathbf{v})} \), where we view \( V \) as a \( k[x]{\hbox{-}} \)module using \( p(x) \curvearrowright\mathbf{v} \coloneqq p(A)(\mathbf{v}) \).

-   Fix \( j \) and define \( h_j(x) = \prod_{i\neq j}(x-\lambda_i)^{n_i} \), the characteristic polynomial with the \( \lambda_j \) term deleted.
-   Define \( W^j \coloneqq\operatorname{im}(h_j(A)) \), then the claim is \( W^j \subseteq V^j \)
    -   This follows because \( 0 = \chi_A(A) = (A-\lambda_j I)^{n_j} h_j(A) \), so in fact \( W^j \subseteq \ker (A - \lambda_j)^{n_j} \).
-   Claim: \( \sum V^j = V \):
    -   Let \( \mathbf{v}\in V \) be arbitrary, then by Euclid's algorithm write \( \sum_i f_i h_i = 1 \) since the \( h_i \) are coprime.
    -   Thus \( \sum f_i(A) h_i(A) = I \implies \qty{\sum f_i(A) h_i(A)}(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v} \implies \mathbf{v} \in \sum W^j \)
-   Claim: the sum is direct.
    -   It suffices to show \( 0=\sum w_i \) with \( w_i \in W^i \) implies \( w_i =0 \) for all \( i \).
    -   Use that \( h_j(w_i) = 0 \) for \( i\neq j \) since \( w_i \in W^i \coloneqq\ker(A-\lambda_I I)^{n_i} \).
    -   Write \( \mathbf{w}_i = \sum f_j(A) h_j(A) \mathbf{w}_i \), which collapses to \( f_i(A) h_i(A) \mathbf{w}_i \).
    -   So \( f_i(A) h_i(A) \qty{\sum w_i} = 0 \implies w_i = 0 \).

### Rational Canonical Form

Corresponds to the **Invariant Factor Decomposition** of \( T \).

::: {.proposition title="Rational Canonical Form"}
\( RCF(A) \) is a block matrix where each block is the companion matrix of an invariant factor of \( A \).
:::

::: {.proof title="Derivation of RCF"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Let \( k[x] \curvearrowright V \) by \( p(x) \curvearrowright\mathbf{v} \coloneqq p(T)(\mathbf{v}) \), making \( V \) into a \( k[x]{\hbox{-}} \)module.

-   \( k \) a field implies \( k[x] \) a PID, so apply structure theorem to obtain an invariant factor decomposition
    \[
    V \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^m k[x] / \left\langle{ p_i(x) }\right\rangle
    && p_1(x) \divides p_2(x) \divides \cdots p_m(x)
    .\]

-   Each \( p_i \) is an invariant factor of \( T \), and the minimal polynomial of \( T \) restricted to \( V_i \).

-   Write \( V \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^m V_i \) where \( V_i \coloneqq k[x] / \left\langle{ p_i(x) }\right\rangle \), then \( A \) is a block matrix \( \bigoplus_{i=1}^m M_i \) where \( M_i \) is the restriction of \( T \) to \( V_i \):
    \[
    \left(\begin{array}{ccccc}M_{1} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & M_{2} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots \\ 0 & \cdots & & & M_{n}\end{array}\right)
    .\]

-   It suffices to determine the form of \( M_i \), so without loss of generality suppose \( m=1 \) so \( V = V_1 = k[x] / \left\langle{ p(x) }\right\rangle \) is a cyclic \( k[x]{\hbox{-}} \)module where \( \deg p(x) = n \).

-   Claim: the set \( \left\{{\mathbf{v}_i}\right\}_{i=0}^{n-1} \coloneqq\left\{{ \mathbf{v}, T\mathbf{v}, T^2\mathbf{v}, \cdots, T^{n-1}\mathbf{v} }\right\} \) is a basis for \( V_1 \).

    -   If there is any linear independence, this gives a polynomial relation \( \sum_{i=1}^{n'} a_iT^i\mathbf{v} = 0 \) for some \( n'<n \), but then \( q(x) \coloneqq\sum_{i=1}^{n'} a_i x^i \) is a polynomial annihilating \( T \), contradicting the minimality of \( p(x) \).
    -   So this yields \( n \) linearly independent vectors in \( k^n \), so it's a basis.

-   What is \( M_i \) in this basis? Check where basis elements are mapped to by \( T \), noting that
    \[
    p(T) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i T^i\mathbf{v} = T^n + a_{n-1} T^{n-1}\mathbf{v} + a_{n-2} T^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1 T\mathbf{v} + a_0 \mathbf{v} = 0
    ,\]
    we can write

    -   \( T\mathbf{v}_0 = \mathbf{v}_1 \)
    -   \( T\mathbf{v}_2 = T^2 \mathbf{v}_0 \)
    -   \( T\mathbf{v}_3 = T^3 \mathbf{v}_0 \)
    -   \( \cdots \)
    -   \( T\mathbf{v}_{n-2} = T^{n-1}\mathbf{v} \)
    -   \( T\mathbf{v}_{n-1} = T^n\mathbf{v} = -a_{n-1}T^{n-1}\mathbf{v} - \cdots - a_1 T\mathbf{v} - a_0 \mathbf{v} \)

    (using the minimal polynomial relation).

-   So we have
    \[
    M_1 = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &  &  &  & -a_0 \\
    1 & 0 &  &  & -a_1 \\
     &  1 &  0&  & -a_2 \\
     &  & \ddots &  0 & \vdots \\
     &  &  & 1 & -a_{n-1} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    .\]

::: {.lemma title="?"}
Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( k \) an algebraically closed and \( A \in \mathrm{End}(V) \). Then if \( W \subseteq V \) is an invariant subspace, so \( A(W) \subseteq W \), the \( A \) has an eigenvector in \( W \).
:::

1.  Hermitian (self-adjoint) matrices (i.e. \( A^{\dagger} = A \)) are diagonalizable over \( {\mathbb{C}} \).
2.  Symmetric matrices (i.e. \( A^t = A \)) are diagonalizable over \( {\mathbb{R}} \).
:::

::: {.remark}
In fact, \( A \) is symmetric \( \iff \operatorname{Spec}A \) forms an orthonormal basis.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Suppose \( A \) is Hermitian.

-   Since \( V \) itself is an invariant subspace, \( A \) has an eigenvector \( \mathbf{v}_1 \in V \).

-   Let \( W_1 = {\operatorname{span}}_k\left\{{\mathbf{v}_1}\right\}\perp \).

-   Then for any \( \mathbf{w}_1 \in W_1 \),
    \[
    {\left\langle {\mathbf{v}_1},~{ A \mathbf{w}_1} \right\rangle} =
    {\left\langle {A \mathbf{v}_1},~{\mathbf{w}_1} \right\rangle} =
    \lambda {\left\langle {\mathbf{v}_1},~{\mathbf{w}_1} \right\rangle} = 0,
    \]
    so \( A(W_1) \subseteq W_1 \) is an invariant subspace, etc.

-   Suppose now that \( A \) is symmetric.

-   Then there is an eigenvector of norm 1, \( \mathbf{v} \in V \).
    \[
    \lambda = \lambda{\left\langle {\mathbf{v}},~{\mathbf{v}} \right\rangle} = {\left\langle {A\mathbf{v}},~{\mathbf{v}} \right\rangle} = {\left\langle {\mathbf{v}},~{A\mathbf{v}} \right\rangle} = \overline{\lambda} \implies \lambda \in {\mathbb{R}}

:::

::: {.proposition title="Simultaneous Diagonalizability"}
A set of operators \( \left\{{A_i}\right\} \) pairwise commute \( \iff \) they are all simultaneously diagonalizable.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
By induction on number of operators

-   \( A_n \) is diagonalizable, so \( V = \bigoplus E_i \) a sum of eigenspaces
-   Restrict all \( n-1 \) operators \( A \) to \( E_n \).
-   The commute in \( V \) so they commute in \( E_n \)
-   **(Lemma)** They were diagonalizable in \( V \), so they're diagonalizable in \( E_n \)
-   So they're simultaneously diagonalizable by I.H.
-   But these eigenvectors for the \( A_i \) are all in \( E_n \), so they're eigenvectors for \( A_n \) too.
-   Can do this for each eigenspace.

\( M \) is diagonalizable over \( {\mathbb{F}}\iff \min_M(x, {\mathbb{F}}) \) splits into distinct linear factors over \( {\mathbb{F}} \), or equivalently iff all of the roots of \( \min_M \) lie in \( {\mathbb{F}} \).

\( \implies \): If \( \min_A \) factors into linear factors, so does each invariant factor, so every elementary divisor is linear and \( JCF(A) \) is diagonal.

\( \impliedby \): If \( A \) is diagonalizable, every elementary divisor is linear, so every invariant factor factors into linear pieces. But the minimal polynomial is just the largest invariant factor.

::: {.problem title="Units or Zero Divisors"}
Every \( a\in R \) for a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor.
:::

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\hfill
```
-   Let \( a\in R \) and define \( \phi(x) = ax \).
-   If \( \phi \) is injective, then it is surjective, so \( 1 = ax \) for some \( x \implies x^{-1}= a \).
-   Otherwise, \( ax_1 = ax_2 \) with \( x_1 \neq x_2 \implies a(x_1 - x_2) = 0 \) and \( x_1 - x_2 \neq 0 \)
-   So \( a \) is a zero divisor.
:::

::: {.problem title="Maximal implies prime"}
Maximal \( \implies \) prime, but generally not the converse.
:::

::: {.solution}
-   Suppose \( {\mathfrak{m}} \) is maximal, \( ab\in {\mathfrak{m}} \), and \( b\not\in {\mathfrak{m}} \).

-   Then there is a containment of ideals \( {\mathfrak{m}}\subsetneq {\mathfrak{m}}+ (b) \implies {\mathfrak{m}}+ (b) = R \).

    \[
    1 = m + rb \implies a = am + r(ab)
    ,\]
    but \( am\in {\mathfrak{m}} \) and \( ab\in {\mathfrak{m}}\implies a\in {\mathfrak{m}} \).

:::

-   Show that for an ideal \( I{~\trianglelefteq~}R \), its radical is the intersection of all prime ideals containing \( I \).
-   Show that \( \sqrt{(}I) \) is the intersection of all prime ideals containing \( I \).

::: {.problem title="Jacobson radical is bigger than the nilradical"}
The nilradical is contained in the Jacobson radical, i.e.
\[
\mathfrak {\sqrt{0_{(}} }R) \subseteq \jacobsonrad(R)
.\]
:::

::: {.solution}
Maximal \( \implies \) prime, and so if \( x \) is in every prime ideal, it is necessarily in every maximal ideal as well.
:::

::: {.problem title="Mod by nilradical to kill nilpotents"}
\( R/\mathfrak {\sqrt{0_{(}} }R) \) has no nonzero nilpotent elements.
:::

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\hfill
```

\[
a + \mathfrak N(R)\text{ nilpotent } &\implies (a+ \mathfrak N(R))^n \coloneqq a^n + \mathfrak N(R)= \mathfrak N(R) \\
&\implies a^n \in \mathfrak N(R) \\
&\implies \exists \ell \text{ such that } (a^n)^\ell = 0 \\
&\implies a\in \mathfrak N(R)
.
\]
:::

::: {.problem title="Nilradical is intersection of primes"}
The nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals, i.e.
\[
\mathfrak{N}(R) = \cap_{\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Spec}(R)} \mathfrak{p}
\]
:::

::: {.solution}
-   \( \mathfrak{N} \subseteq \cap\mathfrak{p} \):

-   \( x \in \mathfrak{N} \implies x^n = 0 \in \mathfrak p \implies x\in \mathfrak{p} \text{ or } x^{n-1}\in\mathfrak p \).

-   \( \mathfrak{N}^c \subseteq \cup\mathfrak{p}^c \):

-   Define \( S = \left\{{I{~\trianglelefteq~}R {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}a^n\not\in I \text{ for any } n}\right\} \).

-   Then apply Zorn's lemma to get a maximal ideal \( {\mathfrak{m}} \), and maximal \( \implies \) prime.
:::

## Characteristic Subgroups

::: {.slogan}
Normality is not transitive!

I.e. if \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) and \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}H \), it's not necessarily the case that \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Characteristic Subgroups"}
A subgroup \( H\leq G \) is **characteristic** in \( G \), written \( H \operatorname{ch}G \), iff for every \( \phi \in \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(G) \), \( \phi(H) \leq H \). Equivalently, \( \phi(H) = H \). I.e. \( H \) is fixed (not necessarily pointwise) under every automorphism of the ambient group \( G \).
:::

::: {.remark title="Characteristic isn't equivalent to normalcy"}
Characteristic subgroups are normal, because \( \psi_g({-}) \coloneqq g({-})g^{-1} \) is an (inner) automorphic of \( G \). Not every normal subgroup is characteristic: take \( G \coloneqq H_1 \times H_2 \) and \( \psi(x, y) = (y, x) \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Fixing transitivity of normality"}
Characteristic subgroups of normal subgroups are normal, i.e. if \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) and \( N \operatorname{ch}H \), then \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \).
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
\( A \operatorname{ch}B {~\trianglelefteq~}C \implies A{~\trianglelefteq~}C \):

-   \( A\operatorname{ch}B \) iff \( A \) is fixed by every \( \psi\in \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(B) \)., WTS \( cAc^{-1}= A \) for all \( c\in C \).
-   Since \( B{~\trianglelefteq~}C \), the automorphism \( \psi({-}) \coloneqq c({-})c^{-1} \) descends to an element of \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(B) \).
-   Then \( \psi(A) = A \) since \( A\operatorname{ch}B \), so \( cAc^{-1}= A \) and \( A{~\trianglelefteq~}C \).

### Exercises

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that \( Z(G) \leq G \) is always characteristic.
:::

::: {.solution}
Let \( \psi\in \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(G) \). For one containment, we can show \( \psi(g) = h = h\psi(g) \) for all \( \psi(g) \in \psi(G) \) and \( h\in G \). This is a computation:
\[
\psi(g) h 
&= \psi(g) (\psi \psi^{-1})(h) \\
&= \psi( g ) \psi( \psi ^{-1}(h)) \\
&= \psi( \psi^{-1}(h) g) \\
&= (\psi\psi^{-1})(h) \psi(g) \\
&= h\psi(g)
.\]
This yields \( \psi(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G) \). Applying the same argument to \( \psi^{-1} \) yields \( \psi^{-1}(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G) \). Since \( \psi \) is a bijection, \( \psi\psi^{-1}(A) = A \) for all \( A\leq G \), so \( Z(G) \subseteq \psi(Z(G)) \).

### Qual Problems

::: {.problem}
Let \( G \) be a finite group and \( p \) a prime number. Let \( X_p \) be the set of Sylow-\( p \) subgroups of \( G \) and \( n_p \) be the cardinality of \( X_p \). Let \( \mathrm{Sym}(X) \) be the permutation group on the set \( X_p \).

1.  Construct a homomorphism \( \rho: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \) with image a transitive subgroup (i.e. with a single orbit).

2.  Deduce that if \( G \) is simple then the order of \( G \) divides \( n_p! \).

3.  Show that for any \( 1\leq a \leq 4 \) and any prime power \( p^k \), no group of order \( ap^k \) is simple.
:::

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
1.  Define the required group action by
    \[\begin{aligned}
            \rho: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \\
            g \mapsto (\gamma_g: P \mapsto gPg^{-1}).
        \end{aligned}\]
    The claim is that this action is transitive on \( X_p \). This can be equivalently stated as
    \[\forall P \in X_p, \exists g \in G, P' \in X_p \mathrel{\Big|}gP'g^{-1} = P.\]

    However, by Sylow 2, all Sylow \( p- \)subgroups are conjugate to each other, and thus this condition is satisfied.

2.  Suppose that \( G \) is simple, so that we have
    \[H \trianglelefteq G \implies H = \{ e \} \text{ or } H = G.\]

    Note that \( \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) = (n_p)! \), and if we have an injective homomorphism \( G \xrightarrow{\phi} \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \), then \( |G| = |\phi(G)| \), since \( \phi(G) \leq \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \) will be a subgroup and thus have order dividing \( (n_p)! \), which proves the statement.

    Using the \( \phi \) defined in (1), we can apply the first isomorphism theorem
    \[G / \ker \phi \cong \mathrm{im} \phi \leq \mathrm{Sym}(X_p),\]
    and so it suffices to show that \( \ker \phi = \{e\} \).

    Note that since \( \ker \phi \trianglelefteq G \) and \( G \) is simple, we can only have \( \ker \phi = \{e\} \) or \( \ker \phi = G \).

    Towards a contradiction, suppose \( \ker \phi = G \).

    By definition, we have
    \[\begin{aligned}
        \ker \phi &= \{ g\in G \mathrel{\Big|}\gamma_g = \mathrm{id}_{X_p} \} \\
        &= \{ g\in G \mathrel{\Big|}\forall P \in X_p,~ gPg^{-1} = P \} \\
        &= \bigcap_{P \in X_p} N_G(P),
        \end{aligned}\]

    and so the kernel of \( \varphi \) is the intersection of all of the normalizers of the Sylow \( p- \)subgroups.

    But this means that \( N_G(P) = G \) for every Sylow \( p- \)subgroup, which means that \( n_p = 1 \) and there is a unique \( P \) which must be normal in \( G \). Since \( G \) is simple, this forces \( P \) to be trivial or the whole group.

    Towards a contradiction, suppose \( P = G \). Then \( G \) is a \( p- \)group and thus has order \( p^n \). But then \( G \) has normal subgroups of order \( p^k \) for all \( 0 < k < n \), contradicting the simplicity of \( G \).

    But the only other option is that \( P \) is trivial, whereas we know nontrivial Sylow \( p- \)subgroups exist by Sylow 1.

    Thus we can not have \( \ker \phi = G \), and so \( \ker \phi \) is trivial as desired.

3.  Suppose \( \left| G \right| = ap^k \), where \( 1 \leq a \leq 4 \). Then by Sylow 3, we have \( n_p = 1 \pmod p \) and \( n_p \) divides \( a \). If \( a=1 \), then \( n_p = 1 \), and so \( G \) can not be simple. Moreover, if \( p \geq a \), then \( n_p \leq a \) and \( n_p = 1\pmod p \) forces \( n_p = 1 \) again.

    So we can restrict our attention to \( 2 \leq a \leq 4 \) and \( p = 2, 3 \), which reduces to checking the cases \( ap^k = 2 (3^k), 4 (3^k) \), or \( 3 (2^k) \) for \( k\geq 1 \).

    If \( ap^k = 2(3^k) \), we have \( n_3 = 1 \pmod 3 \) and \( n_3 \divides 2 \), which forces \( n_3 = 1 \), so this can not be a simple group.

    Similarly, if \( ap^k = 4(3^k) \), then \( n_3 = 1 \pmod 3 \) and \( n_3 \) divides 4, which forces \( n_3 = 1 \) and thus \( G \) can't be simple.

    If \( ap^k = 3(2^k) \), then \( n_2 = 1 \pmod 2 \) and \( n_2 \) divides 3, so \( n_2 = 1, 3 \). But then \( n_3! = 6 \), and if \( k > 1 \), we have \( 3(2^k) > 6 = n_3! \), so \( G \) can not be simple by the result in (2).

    If \( k = 1 \), then \( G \) is order 6, so \( G \) is isomorphic to either \( {\mathbb{Z}}_6 \) or \( S_3 \). The group \( S_3 \) is not simple, since \( A_3 \trianglelefteq S_3 \), and the only simple cyclic groups are of prime order, so \( {\mathbb{Z}}_6 \) is not simple. This exhausts all of the possible cases.
:::

::: {.problem}
Let \( G \) be a finite group and let \( N \trianglelefteq G \), and let \( p \) be a prime number and \( Q \) a subgroup of \( G \) such that \( N \subset Q \) and \( Q/N \) is a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G/N \).

1.  Prove that \( Q \) contains a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G \).

2.  Prove that every Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G/N \) is the image of a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G \).
:::

::: {.solution}
*Proof.*

1.  Since \( Q/N \) is a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G/N \), we can write \( |G/N| = p^k l \) where \( \gcd(p, l) = 1 \), and \( |Q/N| = p^k \).

    We can then write \( |G| = p^n m \) where \( n\geq l \) and \( l\mathrel{\Big|}m \).

    By the third isomorphism theorem, we have
    \[\frac{G/N}{Q/N} \cong G/Q\]
    and so
    \[\left| \frac{G/N}{Q/N} \right| = \frac{|G/N|}{|Q/N|} = \frac{p^k l}{p^k} = l\]

    and so \( |G/Q| = l \) where \( (p, l) = 1 \), and thus
    \[|G/Q| = |G| / |Q| = l \implies |G| = |Q|~l.\]

    We then have
    \[p^n m = |Q|~l,\]

    and since \( (p, l) = 1 \), it must be the case that \( p^n \) divides \( |Q| \). But since \( Q \leq G \), this means that \( Q \) itself must be a Sylow \( p- \) subgroup of \( G \).

2.  Let \( P_N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N) \). By the subgroup correspondence theorem, \( P_n = H/N \) for some \( H\leq G \) such that \( N \subseteq H \).

    So choose \( P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, H) \); the claim is that \( P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G) \) and that \( \frac{P_HN}{N} \cong P_N \), which exhibits \( P_N \) as the image of a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G \).

    We first have \( P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G) \), which follows because we have \( [G/N, H/N] = [G: P_H] \) from the fourth isomorphism theorem, and thus \( [G/N, P_N] = [G : P_H] \). In particular, since \( P_N \) is a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup, \( p \) does not divide \( [G/N, P_N] \) and thus \( p \) doesn't divide \( [G: P_H] \), which makes \( P_H \) a maximal \( p- \)subgroup in \( G \) and thus a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup.

    We then have \( P_HN/N = P_N \), which follows because \( P_H \leq H \implies P_HN/N \leq H/N = P_N \leq G/N \).

    However, it is also the case that \( P_HN/N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N) \). This follows because

    1.  \( P_HN/N = P_H/P_H \cap N \) by the 2nd isomorphism theorem, so it is a \( p- \)group.

    2.  \( P_H \subseteq P_HN \subseteq G \implies p \) doesn't divide \( [G: P_HN] \), since \( P_H \) is also a Sylow \( p- \)group of \( G \) and thus has maximal prime power dividing \( \left| G \right| \).

    3.  \( N \subseteq P_H N \subseteq G \implies [G/N : P_H N/ N] = [G: P_H N] \)

    Taken together, this says that \( P_H N/ N \) is a \( p \)-group and \( p \) doesn't divide \( [G/N, P_HN / N] \), so it is a maximal \( p- \)subgroup and \( P_HN/N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N) \).

    But since \( P_HN/N \leq P_N \) and \( \left|P_HN/N\right| = \left|P_N\right| \), we must have \( P_HN/N = P_N \) as desired.

Let \( G \) be a finite group and \( H<G \) a subgroup. Let \( n_H \) be the number of subgroups of \( G \) that are conjugate to \( H \). Show that \( n_H \) divides the order of \( G \).
:::

::: {.solution}
.\* Let
\[C_H = \{ gHg^{-1} \mathrel{\Big|}g\in G \}\]
be the conjugacy class of \( H \), so \( |C_H| = n_H \).

We wish to show that \( n_{H} \) divides \( |G| \).

**Claim 1**:
\[n_{H} = [G: N_G(H)],\]
where \( N_G(H) \leq G \) is the normalizer of \( H \) in \( G \).

Note that if this claim is true, then we can apply Lagrange's theorem, which states
\[A \leq G \implies |G| = [A: G]~|A|,\]

which in this case translates to
\[|G| = [N_G(H) : G]~|N_G(H)| = n_H~|N_G(H)|.\]

Since \( n_H \) divides the right-hand side, it must divide the left-hand side as well, which is precisely what we would like to show.

**Proof of Claim 1**:

The normalizer of \( H \) in \( G \), written \( N_G(H) \), is the largest subgroup of \( G \) containing \( H \) such that \( H \trianglelefteq N_G(H) \), i.e.
\[N_G(H) = \{g \in G ~\mathrel{\Big|}~ gHg^{-1} = H \} \leq G.\]

Now consider \( S \), the set of left cosets of \( N_G(H) \). Suppose there are \( k \) of them, so
\[[G: N_G(H)] = |S| \coloneqq k.\]

Then \( S \) can be written as
\[S = \{ g_1 N_G(H), ~g_2 N_G(H), ~\cdots, ~g_k N_G(H) \}.\]

where each \( g_i \) is a distinct element of \( G \) yielding a distinct coset \( g_i N_G(H) \). In particular, if \( i\neq j \), then \( g_i \neq g_j \), and \( g_i N_G(H) \not \in g_j N_G(H) \).

In particular, \( S \) acts on \( C_H \),
\[\begin{aligned}
S &\curvearrowright C_H \\
g_i N_G(H) &\curvearrowright H = g_i H g_i^{-1},\end{aligned}\]

taking \( H \) to one of its conjugate subgroups.

So define
\[K \coloneqq 
\{ g_i H g_i^{-1} \mathrel{\Big|}1 \leq i \leq k \}.\]

Note that \( K \subseteq C_H \), and has at most \( k \) elements.

We claim that \( K \) has \( k \) *distinct* elements, i.e. that each \( g_{i} \) takes \( H \) to a *distinct* conjugate subgroup. We have
\[\begin{aligned}
g_{i} H g^{-1}_{i} 
    &= g_{j} H g^{-1}_{j} &\implies \\
g_j^{-1} g_{i} H g^{-1}_{i} g_j 
    &= H &\implies \\
(g_j^{-1} g_{i}) H (g_j^{-1} g_{i})^{-1} 
    &= H &\implies \\
g_j^{-1} g_{i} &\in N_G(H) &\implies \\
g_i &\in g_j N_G(H) &\implies \\
g_i &= g_j,\end{aligned}\]

where the last line follows because we assumed that each coset contains at most one \( g_i \).

Thus \( K \) has \( k \) distinct elements, and so
\[= k = |K| \leq |C_H| = n_H.\]

We now claim that \( k \geq n_H \) as well.

Let \( H' \in C_H \) be any subgroup conjugate to \( H \), so \( H' = gHg^{-1} \) for some \( g\in G \). Then \( g = g_i \) for some \( i \), so \( g \in g_{i} N_G(H) \).

Thus \( g = g_{i} n \) for some \( n\in N_G(H) \), but \( n\in N_G(H) \iff nHn^{-1} = H \) by definition, and so we have
\[\begin{aligned}
    H' 
    &= gHg^{-1} \\
    &= (g_i n) H (g_i n)^{-1} \\
    &= g_i (n H n^{-1}) g_i^{-1} \\
    &= g_i H g_i^{-1} \in K.\end{aligned}\]

Since \( H' \in C_H \) was an arbitrary subgroup conjugate to \( H \), this says that \( C_H \subseteq K \) and thus
\[n_H = |C_H| \leq |K| = k\]

Thus
\[[G: N_G(H)] = k = |M| = |K| = n_H,\]
which is what we wanted to show. ◻

Let \( G=S_5 \), the symmetric group on 5 elements. Identify all conjugacy classes of elements in \( G \), provide a representative from each class, and prove that this list is complete.
:::

::: {.solution}
::: {.claim title="1"}
Conjugacy classes in \( S_n \) are completely determined by cycle type.
:::

This follows because of the result on homework 1, which says that for any two cycles \( \tau,\sigma\in S_n \), we have
\[\tau(s_1~s_2~\cdots~s_k)\tau^{-1} = (\tau(s^1)~\tau(s^2)~\cdots~\tau(s_k)).\]

In particular, this shows that the cycle type of a single cycle is invariant under conjugation. If an element \( \sigma \in S_n \) is comprised of multiple cycles, say \( \sigma = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_\ell \), then
\[\tau(\sigma)\tau^{-1} = \tau(\sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_\ell)\tau^{-1} 
= (\tau\sigma_1\tau^{-1})\cdots(\tau\sigma_\ell\tau^{-1}),\]

which shows that the entire cycle type is preserved under conjugation. So each conjugacy class has exactly one cycle type, and distinct classes have distinct cycle types, so this completely determines the conjugacy classes.

**Claim 2:** Cycle types in \( S_n \) are in bijective correspondence with integer partitions of \( n \).

This follows because any integer partition of \( n \) can be used to obtain a canonical representative of a conjugacy class of \( S_n \): if \( n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots a_n \), we simply take a cycle of length \( a_1 \) the first \( a_1 \) integers in order, a cycle of length \( a_2 \) containing the integers \( a_1 + 1 \) to \( a_2 \) in order, and so on.

Conversely, any permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles, and when the cycles for fixed points are added in, every integer between 1 and \( n \) will appear, and the sum of the lengths of all cycles must sum to \( n \). Thus taking the cycle lengths yields an integer partition of \( n \).

All integer partitions of 5 are given below, along with a canonical representative of the associated conjugacy class.
\[\begin{aligned}
    5 && (1~2~3~4~5) \\
    4 + 1 && (1~2~3~4)(5) \\
    3 + 2 &&  (1~2~3)(4~5) \\

    2 + 1 + 1 + 1 && (1~2)(3)(4)(5) \\
    1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 && (1)(2)(3)(4)(5) \\\end{aligned}\]
