::: {.remark}
Adapted from remark written by Roy Smith, August 2006:

As a general rule, students are responsible for knowing both the theory (proofs) and practical applications (e.g. **how to find the Jordan or rational canonical form** of a given matrix, **or the Galois group of a given polynomial**) of the topics mentioned.

## Definitions

::: {.fact}
An set morphism that is *either* injective or surjective between sets of the same size is automatically a bijection. Consequently, a group morphism between groups of the same size that is either injective or surjective is automatically an isomorphism.
:::

::: {.fact title="The division algorithm"}
If \( a, b\in {\mathbb{Z}} \) with \( \gcd(a, b) = d \), then there exist \( s,t\in {\mathbb{Z}} \) such that
\[
as + bt = d
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
Useful context clue! In particular, this works when \( a, b \) are coprime and \( d=1 \). If you see "coprime" in a finite group question, try the division algorithm.
:::

::: {.definition title="Subgroup Generated by a Subset"}
If \( H\subset G \), then \( \left\langle{H}\right\rangle \) is the smallest subgroup containing \( H \):
\[
\left\langle{H}\right\rangle = \cap\left\{{H{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}H\subseteq M \leq G}\right\} M = \left\{{ h_1^{\pm 1} \cdots h_n^{\pm 1} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}n\geq 0, h_i \in H}\right\}
\]
where adjacent \( h_i \) are distinct.
:::

::: {.definition title="Conjugacy class"}
The **conjugacy class** of \( h \) is defined as
\[
C(h) \coloneqq\left\{{ ghg^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}g\in G }\right\} 
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
\( [e] = \left\{{ e }\right\} \) is always in a conjugacy class of size one -- this is useful for counting and divisibility arguments. Conjugacy classes are **not** subgroups in general, since they don't generally contain \( e \). However, by orbit-stabilizer and the conjugation action, their sizes always divide the order of \( G \).\

Also note that\( [x] = \left\{{ x }\right\} \iff x\in Z(G) \), i.e. having a trivial conjugacy class is the same as being central.
:::

::: {.definition title="Conjugate subgroups"}
Two subgroups \( H, K \leq G \) are **conjugate** iff there exists some \( g\in G \) such that \( gHg^{-1}= K \). Note that all conjugates have the same cardinality.
:::

::: {.definition title="Normal subgroup"}
A subgroup \( N\leq G \) is **normal** iff \( gH = Hg \) for every \( g\in G \), or equivalently \( gHg^{-1}= H \) for all \( g \), so \( H \) has only itself as a conjugate. We denote this by \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \). Equivalently, for every inner automorphism \( \psi \in {\operatorname{Inn}}(G) \), \( \psi(N) = N \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Normal iff disjoint union of conjugacy classes"}
\( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \iff N = {\textstyle\coprod}' [h_i] \) is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes, where the index set for this union is one \( h_i \) from each conjugacy class.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
Note that \( C(h_i) = \left\{{ gh_i g^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}g\in G }\right\} \), and \( gh_i g^{-1}\in H \) since \( H \) is normal, so \( C(h_i) \subseteq G \) for all \( i \). Conversely, if \( C(h_i) \subseteq H \) for all \( h_i \in H \), then \( gh_ig^{-1}\in H \) for all \( i \) and \( H \) is normal.
:::

::: {.definition title="Centralizer"}
\[
C_G(H) = \left\{{g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}ghg^{-1}= h ~\forall h\in H}\right\}
\]
These are elements that fix \( H \) pointwise under the conjugation action.
:::

::: {.definition title="Normalizer"}
\[
N_G(H) = \left\{{g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}gHg^{-1}= H}\right\} = \cup\left\{{H{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}H {~\trianglelefteq~}M \leq G}\right\} M
\]
Contrast to the centralizer: these don't have to fix \( H \) pointwise.
:::

::: {.remark}
\( C_G(S) {~\trianglelefteq~}N_G(H) \) for any \( H \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Commutator"}
The **commutator subgroup** of \( G \) is denoted \( [G, G] \leq G \). It is the subgroup generated by all elementary commutators:
\[
[G, G] \coloneqq\left\langle{ aba^{-1}b^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}a, b\in G }\right\rangle 
.\]

It is the smallest normal subgroup \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) such that \( G/N \) is abelian, so if \( H\leq G \) and \( G/H \) is abelian, \( H\subseteq [G, G] \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Group Presentation"}
An expression of the form \( G = \left\langle{S {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}R}\right\rangle \) where \( S \) is a set of elements and \( R \) a set of words defining relations means that \( G \coloneqq F[S] / { \operatorname{cl}} _n(R) \) where \( F[S] \) is the free group on the set \( S \) and \( { \operatorname{cl}} _n(R) \) is the normal closure, the smallest normal subgroup of \( F[S] \) containing \( R \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Finding morphisms between presentations: if \( G \) is presented with generators \( g_i \) with relations \( r_i \) and \( H \) is any group containing elements \( h_i \) also satisfying \( r_i \), there is a group morphism
\[
\phi: G &\to H \\
g_i &\mapsto h_i \quad \forall i
.\]
Why this exists: the presentation yields a morphism \( \pi: F(g_i) \to G \) with \( G\cong F(g_i) / \ker \pi \). Define a map \( \psi: F(g_i) \to H \) where \( g_i\mapsto h_i \), then since the \( h_i \) satisfy the relations \( r_i \), \( \ker \pi \subseteq \ker \psi \). So \( \psi \) factors through \( \ker \pi \) yielding a morphism \( F/\ker \pi \to H \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="NC Theorem"}
\( N_G(H) / C_G(H) \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \( {\operatorname{Aut}}(H) \).
:::

## Subgroups, Cosets, Quotients

::: {.definition title="Subgroup"}
A subset \( H\subseteq G \) is a **subgroup** iff

1.  Closure: \( HH \subset H \)
2.  Identity: \( e\in H \)
3.  Inverses: \( g\in H \iff g^{-1}\in H \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="One-step subgroup test"}
If \( H \subseteq G \) and \( a,b\in H \implies ab^{-1}\in H \), then \( H\leq G \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of the one-step subgroup test"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Identity: \( a=b=x\implies xx^{-1}=e\in H \)
-   Inverses: \( a=e, b=x \implies x^{-1}\in H \).
-   Closure: let \( x, y\in H \), then \( y^{-1}\in H \) by above, so \( xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1}\in H \).
:::

::: {.fact}
Coprime order subgroups are disjoint, or more generally \( {\mathbb{Z}}_p, {\mathbb{Z}}_q \subset G \implies {\mathbb{Z}}_p \cap{\mathbb{Z}}_q = {\mathbb{Z}}_{(p,q)} \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Intersection of subgroups is a subgroup"}
If \( H, K\leq G \) then \( J \coloneqq H \cap K \leq G \) is a subgroup. Moreover \( J\leq H \) and \( J \leq K \).
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
One-step subgroup test.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Tower law for subgroups"}
\[
K\leq H \leq G \implies [G: K] = [G:H] [H: K]
.\]
:::

::: {.proposition title="Indices grow"}
If \( H, K \leq G \), then
\[
[H: H \cap K ]\leq [G: K] 
.\]
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
Write \( G/H \cap K \coloneqq G/J = \left\{{ h_1J, \cdots, h_m J }\right\} \) as distinct cosets. Then \( i\neq j\implies h_i h_j^{-1}\not \in H \cap K \), but \( h_i h_j^{-1}\in H \) since \( H\leq G \), which forces \( h_i h_j^{-1}\not\in K \). So \( h_i K \neq h_j K \), meaning there are at least \( m \) cosets in \( G/K \).
:::

## Cosets

::: {.proposition title="Cosets are identical or disjoint"}
Any two cosets \( xH, yH \) are either identical or disjoint.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
Note \( x\in xH \), since \( e\in H \) because \( H \) is a subgroup and we can take \( h=e \) to get \( x = xe \coloneqq xh \in xH \). The reverse containment is clear, so \( G = \cup_{x\in G} xH \) is a union of its cosets. Suppose toward a contradiction that \( \ell \in xH \cap yH \) we'll show \( xH = yH \). Write \( \ell =xh_1 =yh_2 \) for some \( h_i \), then
\[
xh_1 = yh_2 &\implies x = yh_2 h_1^{-1}\\
xh_3\in xH &\implies xh_3 = (yh_2h_1^{-1}) h_3 \in yH
,\]
so \( xH \subseteq yH \). A symmetric argument shows \( y_H \subseteq xH \). [^1]
:::

::: {.theorem title="The Fundamental Theorem of Cosets"}
\[
aH = bH \iff a^{-1}b \in H \iff b^{-1}a\in H
.\]
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
[^2]
\[
aH = bH \iff a\in bH \iff a=bh \text{ for some } h \iff b^{-1}a = h \iff ba^{-1}\in H
.\]
:::

::: {.definition title="Index of a subgroup"}
The **index** \( [G: H] \) of a subgroup \( H\leq G \) is the number of left (or right) cosets \( gH \).
:::

::: {.remark title="Common coset trick"}
If you can reduce a problem to showing \( X \subseteq H \), it suffices to show \( xH = H \) for all \( x\in X \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Cosets form an equivalence relation and thus partition a group. Nice trick: write \( G/H = \left\{{ g_1 H, g_2 H,\cdots, g_n H }\right\} \), then \( G = {\textstyle\coprod}_{i\leq n} g_i H \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="Counting Cosets"}
If \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \), then
\[
[G: H] = {\left\lvert {G/H} \right\rvert} = {{\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} \over {\left\lvert {H} \right\rvert}}
.\]
:::

## Special Groups

::: {.definition title="The Dihedral Group"}
A **dihedral group** of order \( 2n \) is given by
\[
D_n = \left\langle{r, s {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}r^n, s^2, rsr^{-1}= s^{-1}}\right\rangle = \left\langle{r, s {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}r^n, s^2, (rs)^2 }\right\rangle
\]
:::

::: {.definition title="The Quaternion Group"}
The **Quaternion group** of order 8 is given by
\[
Q &= \left\langle{x,y,z {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = xyz = -1}\right\rangle \\
  &= \left\langle{x, y {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}x^4 = y^4, x^2 = y^2, yxy^{-1}= x^{-1}}\right\rangle
\]
Mnemonic: multiply clockwise to preserve sign, counter-clockwise to negate sign. Everything squares to \( -1 \), and the triple product is \( -1 \):

For \( n\geq 3 \), \( A_n \) is generated by 3-cycles.

Every 3-cycle \( (abc) \) is even, and thus in \( A_n \). Given an arbitrary even permutation \( (t_1\ldots t_{2k}) \), it decomposes into a product of an odd number of transpositions \( (t_{2j-1} t_{2j}) \). So it suffices to write every such transposition as a 3-cycle. There are only 3 cases the occur:

-   Prove that the size of a conjugacy class of \( g_i \) is the index of its centralizer, \( [G: Z(g_i)] \coloneqq[G: C_G(g_i)] \).

-   Prove that if \( G \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group, every subgroup \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) intersects the center \( Z(G) \).

-   Show that if \( G \) is a finite group acting transitively on a set \( X \) with at least two elements, then there exists \( g \in G \) which fixes no point of \( X \).

-   Let \( p \) be prime. For each abelian group \( K \) of order \( p^2 \), how many subgroups \( H\leq {\mathbb{Z}}^{\times 3} \) are there with \( {\mathbb{Z}}^3/H \cong K \)?

-   Let \( \# G = pq \), with \( p,q \) distinct primes. Show that \( G \) has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, and if \( p\not\equiv 1\pmod q \) and \( q\not \equiv 1 \pmod p \) then \( G \) is abelian.

-   Let \( G \) be a finite group and let \( p \) be the smallest prime dividing \( \# G \), and assume \( G \) has a normal subgroup of order \( p \). Show that \( H \subset Z(G) \).

-   Let \( G \) be finite and \( P \) a Sylow 2-subgroup. Assume \( P \) is cyclic and generated by \( x \). Show that the sign of the permutation of \( G \) corresponding to \( x\mapsto gx \) is 1, and deduce that \( G \) has a nontrivial quotient of order 2.

## Counting Theorems

::: {.theorem title="Lagrange's Theorem"}
\[H \leq G \implies \# H \bigm|\# G.\]
Moreover, there is an equality \( [G:H] = \# G/ \# H \) when \( G \) is finite.
:::

::: {.proof title="of Lagrange's theorem"}
Write \( G/H = \left\{{g_0 H, g_1 H, \cdots, g_N H}\right\} \) for some \( N \coloneqq[G:H] \). Since cosets are equal or disjoint and have equal cardinality,
\[
G = {\textstyle\coprod}_{k \leq N} g_k H \implies \#G = \sum_{k\leq N} \# \qty{g_k H} = \sum_{k\leq N} \# H = N \# H
,\]
so \( \# G = N \# H \), \( \#H \) divides \( \# G \) and \( N = [G:H] \) divides \( \# G \).
:::

::: {.corollary title="?"}
\[
\# G = \#(G/H) \#H \coloneqq[G:H] \, \# H
,\]
or written another way,
\[
\#(G/H) = \# G/ \# H
.\]
:::

::: {.corollary}
The order of every element divides the size of \( G \), i.e.
\[
g\in G \implies o(g) \bigm|o(G) \implies g^{{\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert}} = e
.\]
:::

::: {.warnings}
There do **not** necessarily exist \( H \leq G \) with \( {\left\lvert {H} \right\rvert} = n \) for every \( n \bigm|{\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} \). Counterexample: take \( G = A_5 \), then \( \# G = 5!/2 = 60 \) but \( G \) has no subgroup of order \( 30 \). If it did, this would be index 2 and thus normal, but \( A_{n\geq 5} \) is simple.

Another direct counterexample: \( {\left\lvert {A_4} \right\rvert} = 12 \) but has no subgroup of order 6. If such an \( H \) existed, it can't contain every 3-cycle, since \( A_4 \) is generated by 3-cycles. For \( x \) any 3-cycle *not* in \( H \), use that \( \# A_4/H = 2 \) and consider \( H, xH, x^2H \). \( x\not\in H \), so \( H\neq xH \), but two must be equal:

-   \( x^2H = H \): use \( x^2 = x^{-1} \) since \( x^3=e \), but \( x\in H \implies x^{-1}\in H \), \( \contradiction \)
-   \( xH = x^2H \): the fundamental theorem of cosets forces \( x^{-1}x^2 \in H \), so \( x\in H \). \( \contradiction \)

-   The set of fixed points \(  \mathrm{Fix} (G) = \left\{{g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}gx=x \,\forall x\in G }\right\} = \left\{{ e }\right\} \) is just the identity.

### The Class Equation and Burnside's Lemma

::: {.example title="Conjugation yields centers/centralizers"}
Let \( G \) act on *itself* by conjugation.

-   The orbit \( {\mathcal{O}}(g) = C(g) \) is the **conjugacy class** of \( x \).
    -   Thus the action is transitive iff there is one conjugacy class.
-   The set of fixed points \(  \mathrm{Fix} (G) = Z(G) \) is the **center**.
-   The stabilizer is \( {\operatorname{Stab}}(g) = Z(g) = C_G(g) \), the **centralizer** of \( g \).
-   The kernel is the intersection of all centralizers, i.e. again the **center** \( Z(G) \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that \( [G: C_G(x_i)] \) is the number of elements in the conjugacy class of \( x_i \), and each \( x_i \in Z(G) \) has a singleton conjugacy class.
:::

::: {.corollary}
Directly interpreting this using the orbit-stabilizer formula, the size of a conjugacy class \( C(x) \) is the index of its centralizer, \( [G: C_G(x)] \), i.e.
\[
\# {C(x)} = [G: Z(x)]
.\]
:::

::: {.corollary title="The Class Equation"}
\[
{\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} = {\left\lvert {Z(G)} \right\rvert} + \sum_{\substack{\text{One $g$ from} \\ \text{each nontrivial} \\ \text{conj. class}}} [G: Z(g)]
\]
:::

::: {.proof title="of the class equation"}
\( G \) is a disjoint union of its conjugacy classes, so \( G = \displaystyle\coprod'_{g\in G} C(g) \) where \( {\textstyle\coprod}' \) denotes taking one representative from each conjugacy class. Thus
\[
\# G =  \displaystyle\sum '_{g\in G} \# C(g) =  \displaystyle\sum '_{g\in G} [G: Z(g)]
.\]
Elements \( g \in Z(g) \) in the center satisfy \( Z(g) = \left\{{ e }\right\} \) and \( [G: Z(g)] = 1 \) since \( Z(g) = G \), so pulling these out of the sum yields
\[
\# G 
&=  \displaystyle\sum '_{\substack{g\in G' \\ \# [G:Z(g)] = 1 }} [G: Z(g)] +   \displaystyle\sum '_{\substack{g\in G \\ [G:Z(g)] > 1} } [G: Z(g)] \\

:::

::: {.proof title="of Burnside's Lemma"}
Strategy: form the set \( A \coloneqq\left\{{ (g,x) \in G\times X {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}g\curvearrowright x = x }\right\} \) and write/count it in two different ways. First union over \( G \):
\[
A = \displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} \left\{{ (g, x) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}gx = x }\right\} \cong \displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} \left\{{g}\right\}\times X^g
.\]

Then union over \( X \):
\[
A = \displaystyle\coprod_{x\in X} \left\{{ (g, x) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}gx= x }\right\} \cong \displaystyle\coprod_{x\in X} G_x \times\left\{{ g }\right\} 
.\]
Taking cardinalities, and using the fact that \( \left\{{p}\right\} \times A \cong A \) as sets for any set \( A \),
\[
\displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} X^g
\cong
\displaystyle\coprod_{x\in X} G_x
\implies 
\sum_{g\in G}\# X^g
=
\sum_{x\in X} \# G_x
.\]
Apply orbit-stabilizer:
\[
\# G_x = {\# G \over \# Gx} \implies
\sum_{g\in G} X^g
&= \sum_{x\in X} \# G_x \\
&= \sum_{x\in X} {\# G \over  \# Gx} \\
&= \# G\sum_{x\in X} {1 \over  \# Gx}
,\]
so it suffices to show \( \sum_{x\in X}{1\over \# Gx} = \# X/G \). Proceed by grouping terms in this sum according to which orbit they're in:
\[
\sum_{x\in X} {1\over \# Gx} 
&=
\sum_{Gx \in X/G} \sum_{y\in Gx} {1\over \# Gx} \\
&=
\sum_{Gx \in X/G} {1\over \# Gx} \sum_{y\in Gx} 1 \\
&=
\sum_{Gx \in X/G} {1\over \# Gx} \# G_x \\
&=
\sum_{Gx \in X/G} 1 \\

-   Then \( K\coloneqq\ker \phi \subseteq H \).
-   Since \( G \) is finite and \( K\leq G \), we have \( [G:K] = \# (G/K) = \# G/ \# K \) so \( \# (G/K) \) divides \( \# G \).
-   Since \( G/K \cong K' \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \( S_p \), \( \# (G/K) \) divides \( \# S_p = p! \)
-   So \( \# (G/K) \) divides \( \gcd( \# G, p!) \), which is \( p \) since it was the minimal prime dividing \( \# G \).
-   \( p \) is prime, so if \( \# G/K\neq 1 \) we have \( \# G/K = p \).
-   Since \( K \subset H \) and \( [G:H] = p = [G: K] \), we have \( K = H \).

If \( I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq \cdots \) are ideals then \( \cup_j I_j \) is an ideal.
:::

::: {.proposition}
Every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.
:::

::: {.proof}
Let \( 0 < I < R \) be a proper ideal, and consider the set
\[
S = \left\{{J {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}I   \subseteq J < R}\right\}
.\]

Note \( I\in S \), so \( S \) is nonempty. The claim is that \( S \) contains a maximal element \( M \).

\( S \) is a poset, ordered by set inclusion, so if we can show that every chain has an upper bound, we can apply Zorn's lemma to produce \( M \).

Let \( C \subseteq S \) be a chain in \( S \), so \( C = \left\{{C_1 \subseteq C_2 \subseteq \cdots}\right\} \) and define \( \widehat{C} = \cup_i C_i \).

**\( \widehat{C} \) is an upper bound for \( C \):** This follows because every \( C_i \subseteq \widehat{C} \).

**\( \widehat{C} \) is in \( S \):** Use the fact that \( I \subseteq C_i < R \) for every \( C_i \) and since no \( C_i \) contains a unit, \( \widehat{C} \) doesn't contain a unit, and is thus proper.

\( {\mathbb{GF}}(p^n) \) is the splitting field of \( \rho(x) = x^{p^n} - x \), and the elements are exactly the roots of \( \rho \).
:::

::: {.proof}
Todo. Every element is a root by Cauchy's theorem, and the \( p^n \) roots are distinct since its derivative is identically \( -1 \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Splits Product of Irreducibles"}
Let \( \rho_n \coloneqq x^{p^n} - x \). Then \( f(x) \bigm|\rho_n(x) \iff \deg f \bigm|n \) and \( f \) is irreducible.
:::

::: {.corollary}
\( x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x) \) over all irreducible monic \( f_i \in {\mathbb{F}}_p[x] \) of degree \( d \) dividing \( n \).
:::

::: {.proof}
\( \impliedby \):

-   Suppose \( f \) is irreducible of degree \( d \).
-   Then \( f \bigm|x^{p^d} - x \), by considering \( F[x]/\left\langle{f}\right\rangle \).
-   Thus \( x^{p^d} - x \bigm|x^{p^n} - x \iff d\bigm|n \).

\( \implies \):

-   \( \alpha \in {\mathbb{GF}}(p^n) \iff \alpha^{p^n} - \alpha = 0 \), so every element is a root of \( \phi_n \) and \( \deg \min(\alpha, {\mathbb{F}}_p) \bigm|n \) since \( {\mathbb{F}}_p(\alpha) \) is an intermediate extension.

-   So if \( f \) is an irreducible factor of \( \phi_n \), \( f \) is the minimal polynomial of some root \( \alpha \) of \( \phi_n \), so \( \deg f \bigm|n \).

-   \( \phi_n'(x) = p^nx^{p^{n-1}} \neq 0 \), so \( \phi_n \) is squarefree and thus has no repeated factors. So \( \phi_n \) is the product of all such irreducible \( f \).

### Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory

::: {.theorem title="Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory"}
Let \( L/k \) be a Galois extension, then there is a correspondence:
\[
\left\{{\substack{\text{Subgroups } H \leq \operatorname{Gal}(L/k)}}\right\}
&\rightleftharpoons
\left\{{\substack{\text{Fields }  F \text{ such}\\ \text{that } L/F/k}}\right\} \\
H &\rightarrow \left\{{\substack{E^H \coloneqq~\text{The fixed field of $H$}}}\right\} \\
\left\{{\substack{\operatorname{Gal}(L/F) \coloneqq\left\{{ \sigma \in \operatorname{Gal}(L/k) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\sigma(F) = F}\right\}}}\right\} &\leftarrow F
\]

-   This is contravariant with respect to subgroups/subfields.

-   \( [F: k] = [G: H] \), so degrees of extensions over the base field correspond to indices of subgroups.

-   \( [K : F] = {\left\lvert {H} \right\rvert} \)

-   \( L/F \) is Galois and \( Gal(K/F) = H \)

-   \( F/k \) is Galois \( \iff H \) is normal, and \( \operatorname{Gal}(F/k) = \operatorname{Gal}(L/k)/H \).

-   The compositum \( F_1 F_2 \) corresponds to \( H_1 \cap H_2 \).

-   The subfield \( F_1 \cap F_2 \) corresponds to \( H_1 H_2 \).

### Examples

::: {.example title="Cyclotomic Fields"}
\( \operatorname{Gal}({\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_n)/{\mathbb{Q}}) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(n)^{\times} \) and is generated by maps of the form \( \zeta_n \mapsto \zeta_n^j \) where \( (j, n) = 1 \). I.e., the following map is an isomorphism:
\[
{\mathbb{Z}}/(n)^{\times}&\to \operatorname{Gal}({\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_n), {\mathbb{Q}}) \\
r \pmod n &\mapsto (\phi_r: \zeta_n \mapsto \zeta_n^r )
\]
:::

::: {.example title="Finite Fields"}
\( \operatorname{Gal}({\mathbb{F}}_{p^n}/{\mathbb{F}}_p) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/ \left\langle{ n }\right\rangle \), a cyclic group generated by powers of the Frobenius automorphism:
\[
\varphi_p: {\mathbb{F}}_{p^n} \to {\mathbb{F}}_{p^n} \\
x &\mapsto x^p
\]

:::

::: {.example title="Quadratic Fields"}
Every degree 2 extension \( L/k \) is Galois, except possibly in characteristic 2: if \( \alpha\in L \setminus k \) then \( \min_{\alpha}(x) \in L[x] \) must split in \( L[x] \) since \( \alpha\in L \implies \min_{\alpha}(x) = (x- \alpha)g(x) \) which forces \( \deg(g) = 1 \). So \( L \) is a splitting field. If \( \operatorname{ch}(k) \neq 2 \), then \( {\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\,} \min_{ \alpha}(x) = 2x - \cdots \not\equiv 0 \), making \( L \) separable.
:::

::: {.proposition}
If \( K \) is the splitting field of an irreducible polynomial of degree \( n \), then \( \operatorname{Gal}(K/{\mathbb{Q}}) \leq S_n \) is a transitive subgroup.
:::

::: {.corollary}
\( n \) divides the order \( {\left\lvert { \operatorname{Gal}(K/{\mathbb{Q}})} \right\rvert} \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="Splitting + Perfect implies Galois"}
```{=tex}
\hfill
```
-   If \( \operatorname{ch}k = 0 \) or \( k \) is finite, then \( k \) is perfect.

-   \( k = {\mathbb{C}},{\mathbb{R}}, {\mathbb{Q}}, {\mathbb{F}}_p \) are perfect, so any finite normal extension is Galois.

-   Every splitting field of a polynomial over a perfect field is Galois.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Composite Extensions"}
If \( F/k \) is finite and Galois and \( L/k \) is arbitrary, then \( FL/L \) is Galois and
\[
\operatorname{Gal}(FL/L) = \operatorname{Gal}(F / F\cap L) \subset \operatorname{Gal}(F/k)
.\]
:::

### Counterexamples

::: {.example title="?"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   \( {\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_3, 2^{1/3}) \) is normal but \( {\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1/3}) \) is not since the irreducible polynomial \( x^3 - 2 \) has only one root in it.
-   \( {\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1/3}) \) is not Galois since its automorphism group is too small (only of size 1 instead of 3?).
-   \( {\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1/4}) \) is not Galois since its automorphism group is too small (only of size 2 instead of 4). However, the intermediate extensions \( {\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1/4}) / {\mathbb{Q}}(2^{1/2}) \) and \( {\mathbb{Q}}(\sqrt 2) / {\mathbb{Q}} \) are Galois since they are quadratic. Slogan: "Being Galois is not transitive in towers."
-   A quadratic extension that is not Galois: \( \operatorname{SF}(x^2 + y) \in {\mathbb{F}}_2(y)[x] \), which factors as \( (x - \sqrt{y})^2 \), making the extension not separable.

\( {\mathbb{Q}}\in {\mathsf{{\mathbb{Z}}}{\hbox{-}}\mathsf{Mod}} \) is torsionfree, but not free as a \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)module. This follows because any two elements \( a/b, p/q \) are in a single ideal, since taking \( d\coloneqq\gcd(b, q) \) we have \( 1/a = 1/d + \cdots 1/d \) and similarly \( p/q = 1/a + \cdots + 1/a \), so these are in \( \left\langle{ 1/d }\right\rangle \).

::: {.proposition title="Principal Ideals are Free"}
If \( I {~\trianglelefteq~}R \) is an ideal of \( R \), then \( I \) is a free \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module iff \( I \) is a principal ideal.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
\( \implies \):

Suppose \( I \) is free as an \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module, and let \( B = \left\{{\mathbf{m}_j}\right\}_{j\in J} \subseteq I \) be a basis so we can write \( M = \left\langle{B}\right\rangle \). Suppose that \( {\left\lvert {B} \right\rvert} \geq 2 \), so we can pick at least 2 basis elements \( \mathbf{m}_1\neq \mathbf{m}_2 \), and consider
\[
\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{m}_1 \mathbf{m}_2 - \mathbf{m}_2 \mathbf{m}_1,
\]

which is also an element of \( M \) . Since \( R \) is an integral domain, \( R \) is commutative, and so
\[
\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{m}_1 \mathbf{m}_2 - \mathbf{m}_2 \mathbf{m}_1 = \mathbf{m}_1 \mathbf{m}_2 - \mathbf{m}_1 \mathbf{m}_2 = \mathbf{0}_M
\]

However, this exhibits a linear dependence between \( \mathbf{m}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{m}_2 \), namely that there exist \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \neq 0_R \) such that \( \alpha_1 \mathbf{m}_1 + \alpha_2 \mathbf{m}_2 = \mathbf{0}_M \); this follows because \( M \subset R \) means that we can take \( \alpha_1 = -m_2, \alpha_2 = m_1 \). This contradicts the assumption that \( B \) was a basis, so we must have \( {\left\lvert {B} \right\rvert} = 1 \) and so \( B = \left\{{\mathbf{m}}\right\} \) for some \( \mathbf{m} \in I \). But then \( M = \left\langle{B}\right\rangle = \left\langle{\mathbf{m}}\right\rangle \) is generated by a single element, so \( M \) is principal.

\( \impliedby \): Suppose \( M{~\trianglelefteq~}R \) is principal, so \( M = \left\langle{\mathbf{m}}\right\rangle \) for some \( \mathbf{m} \neq \mathbf{0}_M \in M \subset R \).

Then \( x\in M \implies x = \alpha\mathbf{m} \) for some element \( \alpha\in R \) and we just need to show that \( \alpha\mathbf{m} = \mathbf{0}_M \implies \alpha = 0_R \) in order for \( \left\{{\mathbf{m}}\right\} \) to be a basis for \( M \), making \( M \) a free \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module. But since \( M \subset R \), we have \( \alpha, m \in R \) and \( \mathbf{0}_M = 0_R \), and since \( R \) is an integral domain, we have \( \alpha m = 0_R \implies \alpha = 0_R \) or \( m = 0_R \). Since \( m \neq 0_R \), this forces \( \alpha = 0_R \), which allows \( \left\{{m}\right\} \) to be a linearly independent set and thus a basis for \( M \) as an \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module.

By minimality, \( \min_A \) divides \( \chi_A \). Every \( \lambda_i \) is a root of \( \min_A(x) \): Let \( (\mathbf{v}_i, \lambda_i) \) be a nontrivial eigenpair. Then by linearity,

\min_A(\lambda_i)\mathbf{v}_i = \min_A(A)\mathbf{v}_i = \mathbf{0}

*Notation:* \( A^* \) denotes the conjugate transpose of \( A \).
:::

::: {.lemma title="?"}
Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( k \) an algebraically closed and \( A \in \mathrm{End}(V) \). Then if \( W \subseteq V \) is an invariant subspace, so \( A(W) \subseteq W \), the \( A \) has an eigenvector in \( W \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="The Spectral Theorem"}
```{=tex}

```
1.  Hermitian matrices (i.e. \( A^* = A \)) are diagonalizable over \( {\mathbb{C}} \).
2.  Symmetric matrices (i.e. \( A^t = A \)) are diagonalizable over \( {\mathbb{R}} \).
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Suppose \( A \) is Hermitian.

-   Since \( V \) itself is an invariant subspace, \( A \) has an eigenvector \( \mathbf{v}_1 \in V \).

-   Let \( W_1 = {\operatorname{span}}_k\left\{{\mathbf{v}_1}\right\}\perp \).

-   Then for any \( \mathbf{w}_1 \in W_1 \),
    \[
    {\left\langle {\mathbf{v}_1},~{ A \mathbf{w}_1} \right\rangle} =
    {\left\langle {A \mathbf{v}_1},~{\mathbf{w}_1} \right\rangle} =
    \lambda {\left\langle {\mathbf{v}_1},~{\mathbf{w}_1} \right\rangle} = 0,
    \]
    so \( A(W_1) \subseteq W_1 \) is an invariant subspace, etc.

-   Suppose now that \( A \) is symmetric.

-   Then there is an eigenvector of norm 1, \( \mathbf{v} \in V \).
    \[
    \lambda = \lambda{\left\langle {\mathbf{v}},~{\mathbf{v}} \right\rangle} = {\left\langle {A\mathbf{v}},~{\mathbf{v}} \right\rangle} = {\left\langle {\mathbf{v}},~{A\mathbf{v}} \right\rangle} = \overline{\lambda} \implies \lambda \in {\mathbb{R}}

:::

::: {.proposition title="Simultaneous Diagonalizability"}
A set of operators \( \left\{{A_i}\right\} \) pairwise commute \( \iff \) they are all simultaneously diagonalizable.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
By induction on number of operators

-   \( A_n \) is diagonalizable, so \( V = \bigoplus E_i \) a sum of eigenspaces
-   Restrict all \( n-1 \) operators \( A \) to \( E_n \).
-   The commute in \( V \) so they commute in \( E_n \)
-   **(Lemma)** They were diagonalizable in \( V \), so they're diagonalizable in \( E_n \)
-   So they're simultaneously diagonalizable by I.H.
-   But these eigenvectors for the \( A_i \) are all in \( E_n \), so they're eigenvectors for \( A_n \) too.
-   Can do this for each eigenspace.

\( \implies \): If \( \min_A \) factors into linear factors, so does each invariant factor, so every elementary divisor is linear and \( JCF(A) \) is diagonal.

## Ring Theory

-   Show that if an ideal \( I{~\trianglelefteq~}R \) contains a unit then \( I = R \).
-   Show that \( R^{\times} \) need not be closed under addition.

Ideals

::: {.problem title="Units or Zero Divisors"}
Every \( a\in R \) for a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor.
:::

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\hfill
```
-   Let \( a\in R \) and define \( \phi(x) = ax \).
-   If \( \phi \) is injective, then it is surjective, so \( 1 = ax \) for some \( x \implies x^{-1}= a \).
-   Otherwise, \( ax_1 = ax_2 \) with \( x_1 \neq x_2 \implies a(x_1 - x_2) = 0 \) and \( x_1 - x_2 \neq 0 \)
-   So \( a \) is a zero divisor.
:::

::: {.problem title="Maximal implies prime"}
Maximal \( \implies \) prime, but generally not the converse.
:::

::: {.solution}
-   Suppose \( {\mathfrak{m}} \) is maximal, \( ab\in {\mathfrak{m}} \), and \( b\not\in {\mathfrak{m}} \).

-   Then there is a containment of ideals \( {\mathfrak{m}}\subsetneq {\mathfrak{m}}+ (b) \implies {\mathfrak{m}}+ (b) = R \).

-   So
    \[
    1 = m + rb \implies a = am + r(ab)
    ,\]
    but \( am\in {\mathfrak{m}} \) and \( ab\in {\mathfrak{m}}\implies a\in {\mathfrak{m}} \).

*Counterexample*: \( (0) \in {\mathbb{Z}} \) is prime since \( {\mathbb{Z}} \) is a domain, but not maximal since it is properly contained in any other ideal.
:::

-   Show that the nilradical of a ring is the intersection of all prime ideals \( I{~\trianglelefteq~}R \).
-   Show that for an ideal \( I{~\trianglelefteq~}R \), its radical is the intersection of all prime ideals containing \( I \).
-   Show that \( \mathop{\mathrm{rad}}(I) \) is the intersection of all prime ideals containing \( I \).

::: {.problem title="Jacobson radical is bigger than the nilradical"}
The nilradical is contained in the Jacobson radical, i.e.
\[
\mathfrak {\mathfrak{N}}(R) \subseteq {\mathfrak{J}}(R)
.\]
:::

::: {.solution}
Maximal \( \implies \) prime, and so if \( x \) is in every prime ideal, it is necessarily in every maximal ideal as well.
:::

::: {.problem title="Mod by nilradical to kill nilpotents"}
\( R/\mathfrak {\mathfrak{N}}(R) \) has no nonzero nilpotent elements.
:::

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\hfill
```

\[
a + \mathfrak N(R)\text{ nilpotent } &\implies (a+ \mathfrak N(R))^n \coloneqq a^n + \mathfrak N(R)= \mathfrak N(R) \\
&\implies a^n \in \mathfrak N(R) \\
&\implies \exists \ell \text{ such that } (a^n)^\ell = 0 \\
&\implies a\in \mathfrak N(R)
.
\]
:::

::: {.problem title="Nilradical is intersection of primes"}
The nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals, i.e.
\[
\mathfrak{N}(R) = \cap_{\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Spec}(R)} \mathfrak{p}
\]
:::

::: {.solution}
-   \( \mathfrak{N} \subseteq \cap\mathfrak{p} \):

-   \( x \in \mathfrak{N} \implies x^n = 0 \in \mathfrak p \implies x\in \mathfrak{p} \text{ or } x^{n-1}\in\mathfrak p \).

-   \( \mathfrak{N}^c \subseteq \cup\mathfrak{p}^c \):

-   Define \( S = \left\{{I{~\trianglelefteq~}R {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}a^n\not\in I \text{ for any } n}\right\} \).

-   Then apply Zorn's lemma to get a maximal ideal \( {\mathfrak{m}} \), and maximal \( \implies \) prime.
:::

Normality is not transitive!

I.e. if \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) and \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}H \), it's not necessarily the case that \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Characteristic Subgroups"}
A subgroup \( H\leq G \) is **characteristic** in \( G \), written \( H \char G \), iff for every \( \phi \in {\operatorname{Aut}}(G) \), \( \phi(H) \leq H \). Equivalently, \( \phi(H) = H \). I.e. \( H \) is fixed (not necessarily pointwise) under every automorphism of the ambient group \( G \).
:::

::: {.remark title="Characteristic isn't equivalent to normalcy"}
Characteristic subgroups are normal, because \( \psi_g({-}) \coloneqq g({-})g^{-1} \) is an (inner) automorphic of \( G \). Not every normal subgroup is characteristic: take \( G \coloneqq H_1 \times H_2 \) and \( \psi(x, y) = (y, x) \).
:::

::: {.proposition title="Fixing transitivity of normality"}
Characteristic subgroups of normal subgroups are normal, i.e. if \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) and \( N \char H \), then \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}G \).
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
\( A \char B {~\trianglelefteq~}C \implies A{~\trianglelefteq~}C \):

-   \( A\char B \) iff \( A \) is fixed by every \( \psi\in {\operatorname{Aut}}(B) \)., WTS \( cAc^{-1}= A \) for all \( c\in C \).
-   Since \( B{~\trianglelefteq~}C \), the automorphism \( \psi({-}) \coloneqq c({-})c^{-1} \) descends to an element of \( {\operatorname{Aut}}(B) \).
-   Then \( \psi(A) = A \) since \( A\char B \), so \( cAc^{-1}= A \) and \( A{~\trianglelefteq~}C \).

## Normal Closures and Cores

::: {.definition title="Normal Closure of a Subgroup"}
The smallest normal subgroup of \( G \) containing \( H \):
\[
H^G \coloneqq\{gHg^{-1}: g\in G\} = \bigcap \left\{{N: H \leq N {~\trianglelefteq~}G }\right\}
.\]
:::

::: {.theorem title="Fratini's Argument"}
If \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) and \( P \in \mathrm{Syl}_p(G) \), then \( H N_G(P) = G \) and \( [G: H] \) divides \( {\left\lvert {N_G(P)} \right\rvert} \).
:::

### Exercises

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that \( Z(G) \leq G \) is always characteristic.
:::

::: {.solution}
Let \( \psi\in {\operatorname{Aut}}(G) \). For one containment, we can show \( \psi(g) = h = h\psi(g) \) for all \( \psi(g) \in \psi(G) \) and \( h\in G \). This is a computation:
\[
\psi(g) h 
&= \psi(g) (\psi \psi^{-1})(h) \\
&= \psi( g ) \psi( \psi ^{-1}(h)) \\
&= \psi( \psi^{-1}(h) g) \\
&= (\psi\psi^{-1})(h) \psi(g) \\
&= h\psi(g)
.\]
This yields \( \psi(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G) \). Applying the same argument to \( \psi^{-1} \) yields \( \psi^{-1}(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G) \). Since \( \psi \) is a bijection, \( \psi\psi^{-1}(A) = A \) for all \( A\leq G \), so \( Z(G) \subseteq \psi(Z(G)) \).

### Qual Problems

::: {.problem}
Let \( G \) be a finite group and \( p \) a prime number. Let \( X_p \) be the set of Sylow-\( p \) subgroups of \( G \) and \( n_p \) be the cardinality of \( X_p \). Let \( \mathrm{Sym}(X) \) be the permutation group on the set \( X_p \).

1.  Construct a homomorphism \( \rho: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \) with image a transitive subgroup (i.e. with a single orbit).

2.  Deduce that if \( G \) is simple then the order of \( G \) divides \( n_p! \).

3.  Show that for any \( 1\leq a \leq 4 \) and any prime power \( p^k \), no group of order \( ap^k \) is simple.
:::

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
1.  Define the required group action by
    \[\begin{aligned}
            \rho: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \\
            g \mapsto (\gamma_g: P \mapsto gPg^{-1}).
        \end{aligned}\]
    The claim is that this action is transitive on \( X_p \). This can be equivalently stated as
    \[\forall P \in X_p, \exists g \in G, P' \in X_p \mathrel{\Big|}gP'g^{-1} = P.\]

    However, by Sylow 2, all Sylow \( p- \)subgroups are conjugate to each other, and thus this condition is satisfied.

2.  Suppose that \( G \) is simple, so that we have
    \[H \trianglelefteq G \implies H = \{ e \} \text{ or } H = G.\]

    Note that \( \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) = (n_p)! \), and if we have an injective homomorphism \( G \xrightarrow{\phi} \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \), then \( |G| = |\phi(G)| \), since \( \phi(G) \leq \mathrm{Sym}(X_p) \) will be a subgroup and thus have order dividing \( (n_p)! \), which proves the statement.

    Using the \( \phi \) defined in (1), we can apply the first isomorphism theorem
    \[G / \ker \phi \cong \mathrm{im} \phi \leq \mathrm{Sym}(X_p),\]
    and so it suffices to show that \( \ker \phi = \{e\} \).

    Note that since \( \ker \phi \trianglelefteq G \) and \( G \) is simple, we can only have \( \ker \phi = \{e\} \) or \( \ker \phi = G \).

    Towards a contradiction, suppose \( \ker \phi = G \).

    By definition, we have
    \[\begin{aligned}
        \ker \phi &= \{ g\in G \mathrel{\Big|}\gamma_g = \mathrm{id}_{X_p} \} \\
        &= \{ g\in G \mathrel{\Big|}\forall P \in X_p,~ gPg^{-1} = P \} \\
        &= \bigcap_{P \in X_p} N_G(P),
        \end{aligned}\]

    and so the kernel of \( \varphi \) is the intersection of all of the normalizers of the Sylow \( p- \)subgroups.

    But this means that \( N_G(P) = G \) for every Sylow \( p- \)subgroup, which means that \( n_p = 1 \) and there is a unique \( P \) which must be normal in \( G \). Since \( G \) is simple, this forces \( P \) to be trivial or the whole group.

    Towards a contradiction, suppose \( P = G \). Then \( G \) is a \( p- \)group and thus has order \( p^n \). But then \( G \) has normal subgroups of order \( p^k \) for all \( 0 < k < n \), contradicting the simplicity of \( G \).

    But the only other option is that \( P \) is trivial, whereas we know nontrivial Sylow \( p- \)subgroups exist by Sylow 1.

    Thus we can not have \( \ker \phi = G \), and so \( \ker \phi \) is trivial as desired.

3.  Suppose \( \left| G \right| = ap^k \), where \( 1 \leq a \leq 4 \). Then by Sylow 3, we have \( n_p = 1 \pmod p \) and \( n_p \) divides \( a \). If \( a=1 \), then \( n_p = 1 \), and so \( G \) can not be simple. Moreover, if \( p \geq a \), then \( n_p \leq a \) and \( n_p = 1\pmod p \) forces \( n_p = 1 \) again.

    So we can restrict our attention to \( 2 \leq a \leq 4 \) and \( p = 2, 3 \), which reduces to checking the cases \( ap^k = 2 (3^k), 4 (3^k) \), or \( 3 (2^k) \) for \( k\geq 1 \).

    If \( ap^k = 2(3^k) \), we have \( n_3 = 1 \pmod 3 \) and \( n_3 \bigm|2 \), which forces \( n_3 = 1 \), so this can not be a simple group.

    Similarly, if \( ap^k = 4(3^k) \), then \( n_3 = 1 \pmod 3 \) and \( n_3 \) divides 4, which forces \( n_3 = 1 \) and thus \( G \) can't be simple.

    If \( ap^k = 3(2^k) \), then \( n_2 = 1 \pmod 2 \) and \( n_2 \) divides 3, so \( n_2 = 1, 3 \). But then \( n_3! = 6 \), and if \( k > 1 \), we have \( 3(2^k) > 6 = n_3! \), so \( G \) can not be simple by the result in (2).

    If \( k = 1 \), then \( G \) is order 6, so \( G \) is isomorphic to either \( {\mathbb{Z}}_6 \) or \( S_3 \). The group \( S_3 \) is not simple, since \( A_3 \trianglelefteq S_3 \), and the only simple cyclic groups are of prime order, so \( {\mathbb{Z}}_6 \) is not simple. This exhausts all of the possible cases.
:::

::: {.problem}
Let \( G \) be a finite group and let \( N \trianglelefteq G \), and let \( p \) be a prime number and \( Q \) a subgroup of \( G \) such that \( N \subset Q \) and \( Q/N \) is a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G/N \).

1.  Prove that \( Q \) contains a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G \).

2.  Prove that every Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G/N \) is the image of a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G \).
:::

::: {.solution}
*Proof.*

1.  Since \( Q/N \) is a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G/N \), we can write \( |G/N| = p^k l \) where \( \gcd(p, l) = 1 \), and \( |Q/N| = p^k \).

    We can then write \( |G| = p^n m \) where \( n\geq l \) and \( l\mathrel{\Big|}m \).

    By the third isomorphism theorem, we have
    \[\frac{G/N}{Q/N} \cong G/Q\]
    and so
    \[\left| \frac{G/N}{Q/N} \right| = \frac{|G/N|}{|Q/N|} = \frac{p^k l}{p^k} = l\]

    and so \( |G/Q| = l \) where \( (p, l) = 1 \), and thus
    \[|G/Q| = |G| / |Q| = l \implies |G| = |Q|~l.\]

    We then have
    \[p^n m = |Q|~l,\]

    and since \( (p, l) = 1 \), it must be the case that \( p^n \) divides \( |Q| \). But since \( Q \leq G \), this means that \( Q \) itself must be a Sylow \( p- \) subgroup of \( G \).

2.  Let \( P_N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N) \). By the subgroup correspondence theorem, \( P_n = H/N \) for some \( H\leq G \) such that \( N \subseteq H \).

    So choose \( P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, H) \); the claim is that \( P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G) \) and that \( \frac{P_HN}{N} \cong P_N \), which exhibits \( P_N \) as the image of a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup of \( G \).

    We first have \( P_H \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G) \), which follows because we have \( [G/N, H/N] = [G: P_H] \) from the fourth isomorphism theorem, and thus \( [G/N, P_N] = [G : P_H] \). In particular, since \( P_N \) is a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup, \( p \) does not divide \( [G/N, P_N] \) and thus \( p \) doesn't divide \( [G: P_H] \), which makes \( P_H \) a maximal \( p- \)subgroup in \( G \) and thus a Sylow \( p- \)subgroup.

    We then have \( P_HN/N = P_N \), which follows because \( P_H \leq H \implies P_HN/N \leq H/N = P_N \leq G/N \).

    However, it is also the case that \( P_HN/N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N) \). This follows because

    1.  \( P_HN/N = P_H/P_H \cap N \) by the 2nd isomorphism theorem, so it is a \( p- \)group.

    2.  \( P_H \subseteq P_HN \subseteq G \implies p \) doesn't divide \( [G: P_HN] \), since \( P_H \) is also a Sylow \( p- \)group of \( G \) and thus has maximal prime power dividing \( \left| G \right| \).

    3.  \( N \subseteq P_H N \subseteq G \implies [G/N : P_H N/ N] = [G: P_H N] \)

    Taken together, this says that \( P_H N/ N \) is a \( p \)-group and \( p \) doesn't divide \( [G/N, P_HN / N] \), so it is a maximal \( p- \)subgroup and \( P_HN/N \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G/N) \).

    But since \( P_HN/N \leq P_N \) and \( \left|P_HN/N\right| = \left|P_N\right| \), we must have \( P_HN/N = P_N \) as desired.

Let \( G \) be a finite group and \( H<G \) a subgroup. Let \( n_H \) be the number of subgroups of \( G \) that are conjugate to \( H \). Show that \( n_H \) divides the order of \( G \).
:::

::: {.solution}
.\* Let
\[C_H = \{ gHg^{-1} \mathrel{\Big|}g\in G \}\]
be the conjugacy class of \( H \), so \( |C_H| = n_H \).

We wish to show that \( n_{H} \) divides \( |G| \).

**Claim 1**:
\[n_{H} = [G: N_G(H)],\]
where \( N_G(H) \leq G \) is the normalizer of \( H \) in \( G \).

Note that if this claim is true, then we can apply Lagrange's theorem, which states
\[A \leq G \implies |G| = [A: G]~|A|,\]

which in this case translates to
\[|G| = [N_G(H) : G]~|N_G(H)| = n_H~|N_G(H)|.\]

Since \( n_H \) divides the right-hand side, it must divide the left-hand side as well, which is precisely what we would like to show.

**Proof of Claim 1**:

The normalizer of \( H \) in \( G \), written \( N_G(H) \), is the largest subgroup of \( G \) containing \( H \) such that \( H \trianglelefteq N_G(H) \), i.e.
\[N_G(H) = \{g \in G ~\mathrel{\Big|}~ gHg^{-1} = H \} \leq G.\]

Now consider \( S \), the set of left cosets of \( N_G(H) \). Suppose there are \( k \) of them, so
\[[G: N_G(H)] = |S| \coloneqq k.\]

Then \( S \) can be written as
\[S = \{ g_1 N_G(H), ~g_2 N_G(H), ~\cdots, ~g_k N_G(H) \}.\]

where each \( g_i \) is a distinct element of \( G \) yielding a distinct coset \( g_i N_G(H) \). In particular, if \( i\neq j \), then \( g_i \neq g_j \), and \( g_i N_G(H) \not \in g_j N_G(H) \).

In particular, \( S \) acts on \( C_H \),
\[\begin{aligned}
S &\curvearrowright C_H \\
g_i N_G(H) &\curvearrowright H = g_i H g_i^{-1},\end{aligned}\]

taking \( H \) to one of its conjugate subgroups.

So define
\[K \coloneqq 
\{ g_i H g_i^{-1} \mathrel{\Big|}1 \leq i \leq k \}.\]

Note that \( K \subseteq C_H \), and has at most \( k \) elements.

We claim that \( K \) has \( k \) *distinct* elements, i.e. that each \( g_{i} \) takes \( H \) to a *distinct* conjugate subgroup. We have
\[\begin{aligned}
g_{i} H g^{-1}_{i} 
    &= g_{j} H g^{-1}_{j} &\implies \\
g_j^{-1} g_{i} H g^{-1}_{i} g_j 
    &= H &\implies \\
(g_j^{-1} g_{i}) H (g_j^{-1} g_{i})^{-1} 
    &= H &\implies \\
g_j^{-1} g_{i} &\in N_G(H) &\implies \\
g_i &\in g_j N_G(H) &\implies \\
g_i &= g_j,\end{aligned}\]

where the last line follows because we assumed that each coset contains at most one \( g_i \).

Thus \( K \) has \( k \) distinct elements, and so
\[= k = |K| \leq |C_H| = n_H.\]

We now claim that \( k \geq n_H \) as well.

Let \( H' \in C_H \) be any subgroup conjugate to \( H \), so \( H' = gHg^{-1} \) for some \( g\in G \). Then \( g = g_i \) for some \( i \), so \( g \in g_{i} N_G(H) \).

Thus \( g = g_{i} n \) for some \( n\in N_G(H) \), but \( n\in N_G(H) \iff nHn^{-1} = H \) by definition, and so we have
\[\begin{aligned}
    H' 
    &= gHg^{-1} \\
    &= (g_i n) H (g_i n)^{-1} \\
    &= g_i (n H n^{-1}) g_i^{-1} \\
    &= g_i H g_i^{-1} \in K.\end{aligned}\]

Since \( H' \in C_H \) was an arbitrary subgroup conjugate to \( H \), this says that \( C_H \subseteq K \) and thus
\[n_H = |C_H| \leq |K| = k\]

Thus
\[[G: N_G(H)] = k = |M| = |K| = n_H,\]
which is what we wanted to show. ◻

Let \( G=S_5 \), the symmetric group on 5 elements. Identify all conjugacy classes of elements in \( G \), provide a representative from each class, and prove that this list is complete.
:::

::: {.solution}
::: {.claim title="1"}
Conjugacy classes in \( S_n \) are completely determined by cycle type.
:::

This follows because of the result on homework 1, which says that for any two cycles \( \tau,\sigma\in S_n \), we have
\[\tau(s_1~s_2~\cdots~s_k)\tau^{-1} = (\tau(s^1)~\tau(s^2)~\cdots~\tau(s_k)).\]

In particular, this shows that the cycle type of a single cycle is invariant under conjugation. If an element \( \sigma \in S_n \) is comprised of multiple cycles, say \( \sigma = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_\ell \), then
\[\tau(\sigma)\tau^{-1} = \tau(\sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_\ell)\tau^{-1} 
= (\tau\sigma_1\tau^{-1})\cdots(\tau\sigma_\ell\tau^{-1}),\]

which shows that the entire cycle type is preserved under conjugation. So each conjugacy class has exactly one cycle type, and distinct classes have distinct cycle types, so this completely determines the conjugacy classes.

**Claim 2:** Cycle types in \( S_n \) are in bijective correspondence with integer partitions of \( n \).

This follows because any integer partition of \( n \) can be used to obtain a canonical representative of a conjugacy class of \( S_n \): if \( n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots a_n \), we simply take a cycle of length \( a_1 \) the first \( a_1 \) integers in order, a cycle of length \( a_2 \) containing the integers \( a_1 + 1 \) to \( a_2 \) in order, and so on.

Conversely, any permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles, and when the cycles for fixed points are added in, every integer between 1 and \( n \) will appear, and the sum of the lengths of all cycles must sum to \( n \). Thus taking the cycle lengths yields an integer partition of \( n \).

All integer partitions of 5 are given below, along with a canonical representative of the associated conjugacy class.
\[\begin{aligned}
    5 && (1~2~3~4~5) \\
    4 + 1 && (1~2~3~4)(5) \\
    3 + 2 &&  (1~2~3)(4~5) \\

    1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 && (1)(2)(3)(4)(5) \\\end{aligned}\]

      a_{n 1} x_{1}+a_{n 2} x_{2}+&\cdots+a_{n m} x_{m}=b_{n}
      \]
    has a simultaneous solution \( \iff \) the corresponding matrix equation \( AX = B \) has a solution, where \( A = (a_{ij}), X = [x_1, \cdots, x_m]^t \), and \( B = [b_1, \cdots , b_n]^t \).

2.  If \( A_1, B_1 \) are matrices obtained from \( A, B \) respectively by performing the same sequence of elementary **row** operations, then \( X \) is a solution of \( AX=B \) \( \iff \) \( X \) is a solution of \( A_1 X = B_1 \).

3.  Let \( C \) be the \( n \times (m+1) \) matrix given by
    \[
    C = \left(\begin{array}{llll}{a_{11}} & {\cdots} & {a_{1 m}} & {b_{1}} \\ {} & {} & {} \\ {\cdot} & {} & {} \\ {a_{n 1}} & {\cdots} & {a_{n m}} & {b_{n}}\end{array}\right)
    .\]
    Then \( AX = B \) has a solution \( \iff \) \( \mathrm{rank} A = \mathrm{rank} C \) and the solution is unique \( \iff \mathrm{rank}(A) = m \).

*Hint: use part 2.*

4.  If \( B=0 \), so the system \( AX=B \) is homogeneous, then it has a nontrivial solution \( \iff \mathrm{rank} A < m \) and in particular \( n<m \).
