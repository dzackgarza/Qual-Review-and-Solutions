:::{.definition title="Normal Closure of a Subgroup"}
The smallest normal subgroup of $G$ containing $H$:
\[
H^G \definedas \{gHg^{-1}: g\in G\} = \bigcap \{ N: H \leq N \unlhd G \}
.\]
:::

:::{.definition title="Normal Core of a subgroup"}
The largest normal subgroup of $G$ containing $H$:
\begin{align*}
H_G = \bigcap_{g\in G} gHg^{-1} = \left\langle  N: N \unlhd G ~\&~ N \leq H\right\rangle = \ker \psi
.\end{align*}    
where
\begin{align*}
\psi: G &\to \aut(G/H) \\
g &\mapsto (xH\mapsto gxH)
.\end{align*}
:::

:::{.definition title="Characteristic subgroup"}
$H\leq G$ is *characteristic* iff $H$ is fixed by every element of $\aut(G)$. 
:::

:::{.definition title="Subgroup Generated by a Subset"}
If $H\subset G$, then $\gens{H}$ is the smallest subgroup containing $H$:
\begin{align*}
\gens{H} = \intersect_{H\subseteq M \leq G} M = \theset{ h_1^{\pm 1} \cdots h_n^{\pm 1} \suchthat n\geq 0, h_i \in H}
.\end{align*}
:::


:::{.definition title="Centralizer"}
$$
C_G(H) = \theset{g\in G \suchthat ghg\inv = h ~\forall h\in H}
$$
:::

:::{.definition title="Normalizer"}
$$
N_G(H) = \theset{g\in G \suchthat gHg\inv = H} = \union_{H\normal M \leq G} M
$$
:::

:::{.theorem title="The Fundamental Theorem of Cosets"}
$aH = bH \iff a\inv b \in H \text{ or } aH \intersect bH = \emptyset$
:::

:::{.definition title="The Quaternion Group"}
The *Quaternion group* of order 8 is given by
\begin{align*}
Q &= \generators{x,y,z \suchthat x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = xyz = -1} \\
  &= \generators{x, y \suchthat  x^4 = y^4, x^2 = y^2, yxy\inv = x\inv}
.\end{align*}
:::

:::{.definition title="The Dihedral Group"}
A *dihedral group* of order $2n$ is given by 
\begin{align*}
D_n = \generators{r, s \suchthat r^n, s^2, rsr\inv = s\inv }
.\end{align*}
:::

## The Symmetric Group

:::{.definition title="Parity of a Cycle"}

- A cycle is **even** $\iff$ product of an *even* number of transpositions.

- A cycle of even *length* is **odd**

- A cycle of odd *length* is **even**
:::

Mnemonic: the parity of a $k\dash$cycle is the parity of $k-1$.

:::{.definition title="Alternating Group"}
The **alternating group** is the subgroup of **even** permutations, i.e.
\[A_n \definedas \theset{\sigma \in S_n \suchthat \sign(\sigma) = 1}\] where $\sign(\sigma) = (-1)^{m}$ andd $m$ is the number of cycles of even length.
:::

:::{.corollary title="Alternating Group"}
Every $\sigma \in A_n$ has an even number of *odd* cycles (i.e. an even number of *even-length* cycles).
:::

:::{.example}
\[
A_4 =
&\{\id, \\
&(1,3)(2,4),
(1,2)(3,4),
(1,4)(2,3), \\
& (1,2,3),
(1,3,2), \\
& (1,2,4),
(1,4,2), \\
& (1,3,4),
(1,4,3), \\
& (2,3,4),
(2,4,3)\}
\]
  
:::

:::{.definition title="Transitive Subgroup"}
A subgroup of $S_n$ is **transitive** iff its action on $\theset{1, 2, \cdots, n}$ is transitive. 
:::


Useful Facts:

- $\sigma \circ (a_1 \cdots a_k)\circ \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(a_1), \cdots \sigma(a_k))$
- Conjugacy classes are determined by cycle type
- The order of a cycle is its length.
- The order of an element is the least common multiple of the sizes of its cycles.
- $A_{n\geq 5}$ is *simple*.

## Counting Theorems

:::{.theorem title="Lagrange's Theorem"}
\[H \leq G \implies \abs H \divides \abs G.\]
:::

:::{.corollary}
The order of every element divides the size of $G$, i.e.
  $$
  g\in G \implies o(g) \divides o(G) \implies g^{\abs G} = e
  .$$
:::

:::{.warning}
There does **not** necessarily exist $H \leq G$ with $\abs H = n$ for every $n \divides \abs{G}$.
Counterexample: $\abs{A_4} = 12$ but has no subgroup of order 6.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Cauchy's Theorem"}
For every prime $p$ dividing $\abs{G}$. there is an element (and thus a subgroup) of order $p$.
:::

> This is a partial converse to Lagrange's theorem, and strengthened by Sylow's theorem.

### Group Actions

:::{.definition title="Group Action"}
An action of $G$ on $X$ is a group morphism
\begin{align*}
\phi:G \times X &\rightarrow X \\ 
(g,x) &\mapsto g\cdot x
\end{align*}
or equivalently
\begin{align*}
\phi: G &\to \aut(X) \\
g \mapsto (x \mapsto \phi_g(x) \definedas g\cdot x)
\end{align*}
satisfying

1. $e\cdot x = x$
2. $g\cdot (h\cdot x) = (gh)\cdot x$
:::
  
Useful fact:
$\ker \psi = \bigcap_{x\in X} G_x$ is the intersection of all stabilizers.

:::{.definition title="Transitive Group Action"}
A group action $G\actson X$ is *transitive* iff for all $x, y\in X$ there exists a $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot x = x$.
Equivalently, the action has a single orbit.
:::
 
> Reminder of notation: for a group $G$ acting on a set $X$,
> 
> - $G\cdot x = \theset{g\cdot x \suchthat g\in G} \subseteq X$ is the orbit
>
> - $G_x = \theset{g\in G \suchthat g\cdot x = x} \subseteq G$ is the stabilizer
>
> - $X/G \subset 2^X$ is the set of orbits
>
> - $X^g = \theset{x\in X \suchthat g\cdot x = x} \subseteq X$ are the fixed points


Note that being in the same orbit is an equivalence relation which partitions $X$, and $G$ acts transitively if restricted to any single orbit.

:::{.theorem title="Orbit-Stabilizer"}
$$
\abs{G\cdot x} = [G: G_x] = \abs{G} / \abs{G_x}\quad \text{if $G$ is finite}
$$
:::

> Mnemonic: $G/G_x \cong G\cdot x$.

### Examples of Orbit-Stabilizer

1. Let $G$ act on itself by left translation, where $g \mapsto (h\mapsto gh)$.
  - The orbit $G\cdot x = G$ is the entire group
  
  - The stabilizer $G_x$ is only the identity.
  
  - The fixed points $X^g$ are only the identity.

2. Let $G$ act on *itself* by conjugation.
  - $G \cdot x$ is the **conjugacy class** of $x$ (so not generally transitive)

  - $G_x = Z(x) \definedas C_G(x) = \theset{g \suchthat [g, x] = e}$, the **centralizer** of $x$.

  - $G^g$ (the fixed points) is the **center** $Z(G)$.

:::{.corollary}
The number of conjugates of an element (i.e. the size of its conjugacy class) is the index of its centralizer, $[G: C_G(x)]$.
:::

### The Class Equation

\[
\abs{G} = \abs{Z(G)} + \sum_{\substack{\text{One $x_i$ from} \\ \text{each conjugacy} \\ \text{class}}} [G: C_G(x_i)]
\]

Note that $[G: C_G(x_i)]$ is the number of elements in the conjugacy class of $x_i$, and each $x_i \in Z(G)$ has a singleton conjugacy class.

**Examples**

1. Let $G$ act on $X$, its set of *subgroups*, by conjugation.

  - $G\cdot H = \theset{gHg\inv}$ is the **set of conjugate subgroups** of $H$

  - $G_H = N_G(H)$ is the **normalizer** of in $G$ of $H$

  - $X^g$ is the set of **normal subgroups** of $G$

:::{.corollary }
Given $H \leq G$, the number of conjugate subgroups is $[G: N_G(H)]$.
:::

2. For a fixed proper subgroup $H< G$, let $G$ act on its cosets $G/H = \theset{gH\suchthat g\in G}$ by left translation.

  - $G\cdot gH = G/H$, i.e. this is a *transitive* action.

  - $G_{gH} = gHg\inv$ is a *conjugate subgroup* of $H$

  - $(G/H)^G = \emptyset$

:::{.proposition title="Application of the Class Equation"}
If $G$ is simple, $H < G$ proper, and $[G:H] = n$, then there exists an injective map $\phi: G \injects S_n$.
:::

:::{.proof}
This action induces $\phi$; it is nontrivial since $gH = H$ for all $g$ implies $H = G$; $\ker \phi \normal G$ and $G$ simple implies $\ker \phi = 1$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Burnside's Formula"}
Slogan: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points, i.e.
\[
\abs{X/G} = \frac{1}{\abs G }\sum_{g\in G} \abs {X^g}
\]
:::

### Sylow Theorems

:::{.definition}
A $p\dash$group is a group $G$ such that every element is order $p^k$ for some $k$.
  If $G$ is a finite $p\dash$group, then $\abs G = p^j$ for some $j$.
:::

Write


- $\abs{G} = p^k m$ where $(p, m) = 1$,
- $S_p$ a Sylow$\dash p$ subgroup, and
- $n_p$ the number of Sylow$\dash p$ subgroups.


Some useful facts:

- Coprime order subgroups are disjoint, or more generally $\ZZ_p, \ZZ_q \subset G \implies \ZZ_p \intersect \ZZ_q = \ZZ_{(p,q)}$.

- The Chinese Remainder theorem: $(p, q) = 1 \implies \ZZ_p \times \ZZ_q \cong \ZZ_{pq}$


### Sylow 1 (Cauchy for Prime Powers)

\[
\forall p^n \text{ dividing } \abs{G} \text{ there exists a subgroup of size } p^n
\]

Idea: Sylow $p\dash$subgroups exist for any $p$ dividing $\abs{G}$, and are maximal in the sense that every $p\dash$subgroup of $G$ is contained in a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.

> If $\abs G = \prod p_i^{\alpha_i}$, then there exist subgroups of order $p_i^{\beta_i}$ for every $i$ and every $0 \leq \beta_i \leq \alpha_i$.
> In particular, Sylow $p\dash$subgroups always exist.

### Sylow 2 (Sylows are Conjugate)

All sylow$\dash p$ subgroups $S_p$ are conjugate, i.e.
\[
S_p^i, S_p^j \in \mathrm{Syl}_p(G) \implies \exists g \text{ such that } g S_p^i g\inv = S_p^j
\]

:::{.corollary}
$n_p = 1 \iff S_p \normal G$
:::

### Sylow 3 (Numerical Constraints)

 1. $n_p \divides m~$ (in particular, $n_p \leq m$),

 2. $n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$,

 3. $n_p = [G : N_G(S_p)]$ where $N_G$ is the normalizer.

:::{.corollary}
$p$ does not divide $n_p$.
:::

:::{.proposition}
Every $p\dash$subgroup of $G$ is contained in a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $H \leq G$ be a $p\dash$subgroup.
If $H$ is not *properly* contained in any other $p\dash$subgroup, it is a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup by definition.

Otherwise, it is contained in some $p\dash$subgroup $H^1$.
Inductively this yields a chain $H \subsetneq H^1 \subsetneq \cdots$, and by Zorn's lemma $H\definedas \union_i H^i$ is maximal and thus a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Fratini's Argument"}
If $H\normal G$ and $P \in \mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$, then $H N_G(P) = G$ and $[G: H]$ divides $\abs{N_G(P)}$.
:::

## Products

:::{.theorem title="Recognizing Direct Products"}
We have $G \cong H \times K$ when

- $H, K \normal G$

- $G = HK$.

- $H\intersect K = \theset{e} \subset G$

> Note: can relax to $[h,k] = 1$ for all $h, k$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Recognizing Generalized Direct Products"}
We have $G = \prod_{i=1}^n H_i$ when

- $H_i \normal G$ for all $i$.

- $G = H_1 \cdots H_n$

- $H_k \intersect H_1 \cdots \hat{H_k} \cdots H_n = \emptyset$

> Note on notation: intersect $H_k$ with the amalgam *leaving out* $H_k$.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Recognizing Semidirect Products"}
We have $G = N \semidirect_\psi H$ when

- $G =  NH$

- $N \normal G$

- $H \actson N$ by conjugation via a map
  \[  
  \psi: H \to \Aut(N) \\
  h \mapsto h(\wait)h^{-1}
  .\]

> Note relaxed conditions compared to direct product: $H\normal G$ and $K\leq G$ to get a semidirect product instead
:::

**Useful Facts**

-  If $\sigma \in \Aut(H)$, then \(N \semidirect_\psi H \cong N \semidirect_{\psi \circ \sigma} H\).

- $\Aut((\ZZ/(p)^n) \cong \GL(n, \FF_p)$, which has size 
\[  
\abs{\Aut(\ZZ/(p)^n)} = (p^n-1)(p^n-p)\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1})
.\]
  
  - If this occurs in a semidirect product, it suffices to consider similarity classes of matrices (i.e. just use canonical forms)

- \[ \Aut(\ZZ/(n)) \cong \ZZ/(n)\units \cong \ZZ/({\varphi(n)})\] where $\varphi$ is the totient function.
  - $\varphi(p^k) = p^{k-1}(p-1)$

- If $G, H$ have coprime order then $\Aut(G\oplus H) \cong \Aut(G) \oplus \Aut(H)$.


## Isomorphism Theorems

:::{.theorem title="1st Isomorphism Theorem"}
If $\phi:G\to H$ is a group morphism then \[G/\ker \phi \cong \im \phi.\]

Note: for this to make sense, we also have

- $\ker \phi \normal G$
- $\im \phi \leq G$
:::

:::{.corollary}
If $\phi: G\to H$ is surjective then $H\cong G/\ker \phi$.
:::

:::{.proposition}
If $H,K \leq G$ and $H \leq N_G(K)$ (or $K \normal G$) then $HK \leq G$ is a subgroup.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Diamond Theorem / 2nd Isomorphism Theorem"}
If $S \leq G$ and $N \normal G$, then
\[
\frac{SN}{N} \cong \frac{S}{S\intersect N} \quad \text{ and }\quad \abs{SN} = \frac{\abs S \abs N}{\abs{S\intersect N}}
.\]

Note: for this to make sense, we also have
    
- $SN \leq G$,
- $S\intersect N \normal S$,
:::

![The 2nd "Diamond" Isomorphism Theorem](figures/2020-01-01-15-20-27.png)

:::{.corollary}
If we relax the conditions to $S, N \leq G$ with $S \in N_G(N)$, then $S\intersect N \normal S$ (but is not normal in $G$) and the theorem still applies.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Cancellation / 3rd Isomorphism Theorem"}
Suppose $N, K \leq G$ with $N \normal G$ and $N\subseteq K \subseteq G$.

    1. If $K\leq G$ then $K/N \leq G/N$ is a subgroup
    2. If $K\normal G$ then $K/N \normal G/N$.
    3. Every subgroup of $G/N$ is of the form $K/N$ for some such $K \leq G$.
    3. Every *normal* subgroup of $G/N$ is of the form $K/N$ for some such $K \normal G$.
    4. If $K\normal G$, then we can cancel normal subgroups:
    \[  
    \frac{G/N}{K/N} \cong \frac{G}{K}
    .\]
:::


:::{.theorem title="The Correspondence Theorem / 4th Isomorphism Theorem"}
Suppose $N \normal G$, then there exists a correspondence:

\[  
\left\{

## Special Classes of Groups

:::{.definition title="2 out of 3 Property"}
The **"2 out of 3 property"** is satisfied by a class of groups $\mathcal C$ iff whenever $G \in \mathcal C$, then $N, G/N \in \mathcal{C}$ for any $N \normal G$.
:::

:::{.definition title="p-groups"}
If $\abs{G} = p^k$, then $G$ is a **p-group.**
:::

:::{.definition title="Normalizers Grow"}
If for every proper $H<G$, $H\normal N_G(H)$ is again proper, then "normalizers grow" in $G$.
:::

## Classification of Groups

General strategy: find a normal subgroup (usually a Sylow) and use recognition of semidirect products.

## Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

:::{.definition title="Invariant Factor Decomposition"}
$$
G \cong \ZZ^r \times \prod_{j=1}^m \ZZ/n_j\ZZ
\quad \text{ where } n_1 \divides \cdots \divides n_m
.$$
:::

**Invariant factors $\to$ Elementary Divisors:**

- Take prime factorization of each factor
- Split into coprime pieces

:::{.example}
\begin{align*}
\ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7}
\cong
\ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{2^3} \times \ZZ_{5^2} \times \ZZ_7
.\end{align*}
:::

**Going from elementary divisors to invariant factors:**

- Bin up by primes occurring (keeping exponents)
- Take highest power from each prime as *last* invariant factor
- Take highest power from all remaining primes as next, etc

:::{.example}
Given the invariant factor decomposition
\begin{align*}
G = {\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{3}\times\mathbb{Z}_{3}\times\mathbb{Z}_{5^2}}
.\end{align*}

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2,2,2$ |  $3,3$ | $5^2$

$\implies n_m = 5^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2,2$ |  $3$ | $\emptyset$

$\implies n_{m-1} = 3 \cdot 2$

| $p = 2$  | $p= 3$  | $p =5$ |
|---|---|---|
|  $2$ |  $\emptyset$ | $\emptyset$

$\implies n_{m-2} = 2$

and thus
\begin{align*}
G\cong \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_{3\cdot 2} \times \ZZ_{5^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}
.\end{align*}
:::

**Classifying Abelian Groups of a Given Order:**


Let $p(x)$ be the integer partition function.

> Example: $p(6) = 11$, given by $6, 5+1, 4+2, \cdots$.

Write $G = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots$; then there are $p(k_1) p(k_2) \cdots$ choices, each yielding a distinct group.

Set $Z_0 = 1$, $Z_1 = Z(G)$, and $Z_{i+1} \leq G$ to be the subgroup satisfying $Z_{i+1}/Z_i = Z(G/Z_i)$.
  Then $Z_0 \leq Z_1 \leq \cdots$ is the *upper central series* of $G$.

  Equivalently, since $Z_i\normal G$, there is a quotient map $\pi:G\to G/Z_i$, so define $Z_{i+1} \definedas \pi\inv(Z(G/Z_i))$ (?).

> Mnemonic: "upper" because the chain is ascending. "Take higher centers".
:::

:::{.definition title="Derived Series"}
Set $G^{(0)} = G$ and $G^{(i+1)} = [G^{(i)}, G^{(i)}]$, then $G^{(0)} \geq G^{(1)} \geq \cdots$ is the *derived series* of $G$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Solvable"}
A group $G$ is **solvable** iff $G$ has a terminating normal series with abelian composition factors, i.e.

### Zorn's Lemma

:::{.theorem title="Zorn's Lemma"}
If $P$ is a poset in which every chain has an upper bound, then $P$ has a maximal element.
:::

Some useful propositions used when *applying* Zorn's lemma:

:::{.proposition}
Fields are simple rings. 
:::

:::{.proposition}
If $I\normal R$ is a proper ideal $\iff I$ contains no units.
:::

:::{.proof}
$r\in R\units \intersect I \implies r\inv r \in I \implies 1\in I \implies x\cdot 1 \in I \quad \forall x\in R$.
:::

:::{.proposition}
If $I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq \cdots$ are ideals then $\union_j I_j$ is an ideal.
:::

:::{.proposition}
Every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $0 < I < R$ be a proper ideal, and consider the set
$$
S = \theset{J \suchthat I   \subseteq J < R}
.$$

Note $I\in S$, so $S$ is nonempty.
The claim is that $S$ contains a maximal element $M$.

$S$ is a poset, ordered by set inclusion, so if we can show that every chain has an upper bound, we can apply Zorn's lemma to produce $M$.

Let $C \subseteq S$ be a chain in $S$, so $C = \theset{C_1 \subseteq C_2 \subseteq \cdots}$ and define $\hat C = \union_i C_i$.

**$\hat C$ is an upper bound for $C$:**
This follows because every $C_i \subseteq \hat C$.

**$\hat C$ is in $S$:**
Use the fact that $I \subseteq C_i < R$ for every $C_i$ and since no $C_i$ contains a unit, $\hat C$ doesn't contain a unit, and is thus proper.

# Fields

Let $k$ denote a field.

**Lemmas:**

- The characteristic of any field $k$ is either 0 or $p$ a prime.
- All fields are simple rings (no proper nontrivial ideals).
- If $L/k$ is algebraic, then $\min(\alpha, L)$ divides $\min(\alpha, k)$.
- Every field morphism is either zero or injective.

Theorem
: Every finite extension is algebraic.

Proof
: Todo?

Theorem (Gauss' Lemma)
:   Let $R$ be a UFD and $F$ its field of fractions.
    Then a primitive $p\in R[x]$ is irreducible in $R[x] \iff p$ is irreducible in $F[x]$.

Corollary
: A primitive polynomial $p\in \QQ[x]$ is irreducible $\iff p$ is irreducible in $\ZZ[x]$.


Theorem (Eisenstein's Criterion)
:   If $f(x) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i x^i \in \QQ[x]$ and $\exists p$ such that

    - $p$ divides every coefficient *except* $a_n$ and
    - $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$,

    then $f$ is irreducible over $\QQ[x]$, and by Gauss' lemma, over $\ZZ[x]$.

Definition (Primitive)
: For $R$ a UFD, a polynomial $p\in R[x]$ is **primitive** iff the greatest common divisors of its coefficients is a unit.


## Finite Fields

Definition
: The **prime subfield** of a field $F$ is the subfield generated by $1$.

Lemma (Characterization of Prime Subfields)
: The prime subfield of any field is isomorphic to either $\QQ$ or $\FF_p$ for some $p$.

Proposition (Freshman's Dream)
: If $\ch k = p$ then $(a+b)^p = a^p + b^p$ and $(ab)^p = a^p b^p$.

Proof
: Todo

Theorem (Construction of Finite Fields)
: $\GF(p^n)\cong \displaystyle\frac{\FF_p}{(f)}$ where $f \in \FF_p[x]$ is any irreducible of degree $n$, and $\GF(p^n) \cong \FF[\alpha] \cong \spanof_\FF\theset{1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{n-1}}$ for any root $\alpha$ of $f$.

Lemma (Prime Subfields of Finite Fields)
: Every finite field $F$ is isomorphic to a unique field of the form $\GF(p^n)$ and if $\ch F = p$, it has prime subfield $\FF_p$.

Lemma (Containment of Finite Fields)
: $\GF(p^\ell) \leq \GF(p^k) \iff \ell$ divides $k$.

Lemma (Identification of Finite Fields as Splitting Fields)
: $\GF(p^n)$ is the splitting field of $\rho(x) = x^{p^n} - x$, and the elements are exactly the roots of $\rho$.

Proof
: Todo.
  Every element is a root by Cauchy's theorem, and the $p^n$ roots are distinct since its derivative is identically $-1$.

Lemma (Splits Product of Irreducibles)
:   Let $\rho_n \definedas x^{p^n} - x$.
    Then $f(x) \divides \rho_n(x) \iff \deg f \divides n$ and $f$ is irreducible.

Corollary
: $x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i \in \FF_p[x]$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$.

Proof
:   \hfill

    $\impliedby$:
    Suppose $f$ is irreducible of degree $d$.
    Then $f \divides x^{p^d} - x$ (consider $F[x]/\generators{f}$) and $x^{p^d} - x \divides x^{p^n} - x \iff d\divides n$.

    $\implies$:

    - $\alpha \in \GF(p^n) \iff \alpha^{p^n} - \alpha = 0$, so every element is a root of $\phi_n$ and $\deg \min(\alpha, \FF_p) \divides n$ since $\FF_p(\alpha)$ is an intermediate extension.
    
    - So if $f$ is an irreducible factor of $\phi_n$, $f$ is the minimal polynomial of some root $\alpha$ of $\phi_n$, so $\deg f \divides n$.
    $\phi_n'(x) = p^nx^{p^{n-1}} \neq 0$, so $\phi_n$ has distinct roots and thus no repeated factors. So $\phi_n$ is the product of all such irreducible $f$.

Lemma
: No finite field is algebraically closed.

Proof
: Todo?

## Galois Theory

Definition
:   A field extension $L/k$ is **algebraic** iff every $\alpha \in L$ is the root of some polynomial $f\in k[x]$.

Definition
:   Let $L/k$ be a finite extension.
    Then TFAE:

    - $L/k$ is **normal**.

    - Every irreducible $f\in k[x]$ that has one root in $L$ has *all* of its roots in $L$
      - i.e. every polynomial splits into linear factors

    - Every embedding $\sigma: L \injects \overline k$ that is a lift of the identity on $k$ satisfies $\sigma(L) = L$.

    - If $L$ is separable: $L$ is the splitting field of some irreducible $f\in k[x]$.

Definition
:   Let $L/k$ be a field extension, $\alpha \in L$ be arbitrary, and $f(x) \definedas\min(\alpha, k)$.
    TFAE:

    - $L/k$ is **separable**
    - $f$ has no repeated factors/roots
    - $\gcd(f, f') = 1$, i.e. $f$ is coprime to its derivative
    - $f' \not\equiv 0$

Lemma
: If $\ch k = 0$ or $k$ is finite, then every *algebraic* extension $L/k$ is separable.

Definition
: $\aut(L/k) = \theset{\sigma: L \to L \suchthat \restrictionof{\sigma}{k} = \id_k}$.

Lemma
: If $L/k$ is algebraic, then $\Aut(L/k)$ permutes the roots of irreducible polynomials.

Lemma
: $\abs{\aut(L/k)} \leq [L: k]$ with equality precisely when $L/k$ is normal.

Definition
: If $L/k$ is Galois, we define $\Gal(L/k) \definedas \Aut(L/k)$.

### Lemmas About Towers

Let $L/F/k$ be a finite tower of field extensions

- Multiplicativity: $[L : k] = [L: F][F: k]$

- $L/k$ normal/algebraic/Galois $\implies L/F$ normal/algebraic/Galois.
  - *Proof (normal):*
  $\min(\alpha, F) \divides \min(\alpha, k)$, so if the latter splits in $L$ then so does the former.
  - *Corollary:* $\alpha \in L$ algebraic over $k \implies \alpha$ algebraic over $F$.
  - *Corollary:* $E_1/k$ normal and $E_2/k$ normal $\implies E_1E_2/k$ normal and $E_1 \intersect E_2 / k$ normal.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
L \arrow[d, dotted, bend right=49] \arrow[dd, bend left=49] \\
F                                                           \\
k
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

- $F/k$ algebraic and $L/F$ algebraic $\implies L/k$ algebraic.

- If $L/k$ is algebraic, then $F/k$ separable and $L/F$ separable $\iff L/k$ separable

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
L \arrow[d, bend right=49] \arrow[dd, dashed, bend left=49] \\
F \arrow[d, bend right=49]                                  \\
k
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

- $F/k$ Galois and $L/K$ Galois $\implies F/k$  Galois **only if** $\Gal(L/F) \normal \Gal(L/k)$
  - $\implies \Gal(F/k) \cong \frac{\Gal(L/k)}{\Gal(L/F)}$

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
L \arrow[d, dotted, bend right=49] \arrow[dd, bend left=49] \\
F \arrow[d, bend right=49]                                  \\
k
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

**Common Counterexamples**:

- $\QQ(\zeta_3, 2^{1/3})$ is normal but $\QQ(2^{1/3})$ is not since the irreducible polynomial $x^3 - 2$ has only one root in it.

Definition (Characterizations of Galois Extensions)
:   Let $L/k$ be a finite field extension.
    TFAE:

    - $L/k$ is **Galois**
    - $L/k$ is finite, normal, and separable.
    - $L/k$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial
    - $\abs{\aut(L/k)} = [L: k]$
    - The fixed field of $\mathrm{Aut}(L/k)$ is exactly $k$.

Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory)
:   Let $L/k$ be a Galois extension, then there is a correspondence:
    \begin{align*}
    \correspond{\text{Subgroups } H \leq \Gal(L/k)}
    &\iff
    \correspond{\text{Fields }  F \text{ such}\\ \text{that } L/F/k} \\
    H &\rightarrow \correspond{E^H \definedas ~\text{The fixed field of $H$}} \\
    \correspond{\Gal(L/F) \definedas \theset{ \sigma \in \Gal(L/k) \suchthat \sigma(F) = F}} &\leftarrow F
    .\end{align*}

    - This is contravariant with respect to subgroups/subfields.

    - $[F: k] = [G: H]$, so degrees of extensions over the base field correspond to indices of subgroups.

    - $[K : F] = \abs{H}$

    - $L/F$ is Galois and $Gal(K/F) = H$

    - $F/k$ is Galois $\iff H$ is normal, and $\Gal(F/k) = \Gal(L/k)/H$.

    - The compositum $F_1 F_2$ corresponds to $H_1 \intersect H_2$.

    - The subfield $F_1 \intersect F_2$ corresponds to $H_1 H_2$.

### Examples

1.
$\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_n)/\QQ) \cong \ZZ/(n)\units$ and is generated by maps of the form $\zeta_n \mapsto \zeta_n^j$ where $(j, n) = 1$.

    I.e., the following map is an isomorphism:
\begin{align*}
\ZZ/(n)\units &\to \Gal(\QQ(\zeta_n), \QQ) \\
r \mod n &\mapsto (\phi_r: \zeta_n \mapsto \zeta_n^r )
.\end{align*}

2.
$\Gal(\GF(p^n)/\FF_p) \cong \ZZ/(n)$, a cyclic group generated by powers of the Frobenius automorphism:
\begin{align*}
\varphi_p: \GF(p^n) &\to \GF(p^n) \\
x &\mapsto x^p
.\end{align*}

Lemma
: Every quadratic extension is Galois.

Lemma
: If $K$ is the splitting field of an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$, then $\Gal(K/\QQ) \leq S_n$ is a transitive subgroup.

Corollary
: $n$ divides the order $\abs{ \Gal(K/\QQ)}$.

Definition
:   TFAE:

    - $k$ is a **perfect** field.

    - Every irreducible polynomial $p\in k[x]$ is separable

    - Every finite extension $F/k$ is separable.

    - If $\ch k > 0$, the Frobenius is an automorphism of $k$.

Theorem
:   \hfill

    - If $\ch k = 0$ or $k$ is finite, then $k$ is perfect.

    - $k = \QQ, \FF_p$ are perfect, and any finite normal extension is Galois.

    - Every splitting field of a polynomial over a perfect field is Galois.

Proposition (Composite Extensions)
:   If $F/k$ is finite and Galois and $L/k$ is arbitrary, then $FL/L$ is Galois and
    $$
    \Gal(FL/L) = \Gal(F / F\intersect L) \subset \Gal(F/k)
    .$$

## Cyclotomic Polynomials

Definition (Cyclotomic Polynomials)
:   Let $\zeta_n = e^{2\pi i/n}$, then the **$n$th cyclotomic polynomial** is given by
    $$
    \Phi_{n}(x)=\prod_{k=1 \atop (j, n)=1}^{n}\left(x- \zeta_n^k\right)
    ,$$

    which is a product over primitive roots of unity.
    It is the unique irreducible polynomial which is a divisor of $x^n - 1$ but *not* a divisor of $x^k-1$ for any $k<n$.


Proposition
: $\deg \Phi_n(x) = \phi(n)$ for $\phi$ the totient function.

Proof
: $\deg \Phi_n(x)$ is the number of $n$th primitive roots, which is the number of numbers less than and coprime to $n$.

**Computing $\Phi_n$:**

1.
$$
\Phi_{n}(z)=\prod_{d | n, d>0}\left(z^{d}-1\right)^{\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)}
$$
where
$$
\mu(n) \equiv\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{0} & {\text { if } n \text { has one or more repeated prime factors }} \\ {1} & {\text { if } n=1} \\ {(-1)^{k}} & {\text { if } n \text { is a product of } k \text { distinct primes, }}\end{array}\right.
$$

2.
$$
x^{n}-1=\prod_{d | n} \Phi_{d}(x) \implies \Phi_n(x) = \frac{x^n-1}{\prod_{d | n \atop d < n} \Phi_{d}(x)},
$$
so just use polynomial long division.

Lemma
:   \hfill
    \begin{align*}
    \Phi_{p}(x)   &=  x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\cdots+x+1 \\
    \Phi_{2 p}(x) &=  x^{p-1}-x^{p-2}+\cdots-x+1
    .\end{align*}

Lemma
:   \hfill
    $$
    k\divides n \implies \Phi_{n k}(x)=\Phi_{n}\left(x^{k}\right)
    $$

Definition
: An extension $F/k$ is **simple** if $F = k[\alpha]$ for a single element $\alpha$.

Theorem (Primitive Element)
: Every finite separable extension is simple.

Corollary
: $\GF(p^n)$ is a simple extension over $\FF_p$.

# Modules

## General Modules

Definition (Simple Module)
: A module is **simple** iff it has no nontrivial proper submodules.

Definition (Free Module)
: A **free** module is a module with a basis (i.e. a spanning, linearly independent set).

Example
: $\ZZ/(6)$ is a $\ZZ\dash$module that is *not* free.

Definition (Projective Module)
: A module $M$ is **projective** iff $M$ is a direct summand of a free module $F = M \oplus \cdots$.

Free implies projective, but not the converse.

Definition (Exact Sequences)
: A sequence of module morphisms $0 \mapsvia{d_1} A \mapsvia{d_2} B \mapsvia{d_3} C \to 0$ is *exact* iff $\im d_i = \ker d_{i+1}$.

Proposition (Splitting Exact Sequences)
:   If $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ is a short exact sequence, then

    - $C$ free $\implies$ the sequence splits
    - $C$ projective $\implies$ the sequence splits
    - $A$ injective $\implies$ the sequence splits

    Moreover, if this sequence splits, then $B \cong A \oplus C$.

## Classification of Modules over a PID

Let $M$ be a finitely generated modules over a PID $R$.
Then there is an invariant factor decomposition

\begin{align*}
M \cong F \bigoplus R/(r_i) \quad\text{where } r_1 \divides r_2 \divides \cdots
,\end{align*}

and similarly an elementary divisor decomposition.

Proposition (Principal Ideals are Free)
: $I \normal R$ is a free $R\dash$module iff $I$ is a principal ideal.

Proof
:   $\implies$:

    Suppose $I$ is free as an $R\dash$module, and let $B = \theset{\vector m_j}_{j\in J} \subseteq I$ be a basis so we can write $M = \generators{B}$.

    Suppose that $\abs{B} \geq 2$, so we can pick at least 2 basis elements $\vector m_1\neq \vector m_2$, and consider
    $$
    \vector c = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_2 \vector m_1,
    $$

    which is also an element of $M$ .

    Since $R$ is an integral domain, $R$ is commutative, and so
    $$
    \vector c = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_2 \vector m_1 = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_1 \vector m_2 = \vector 0_M
    $$

    However, this exhibits a linear dependence between $\vector m_1$ and $\vector m_2$, namely that there exist $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \neq 0_R$ such that $\alpha_1 \vector m_1 + \alpha_2 \vector m_2 = \vector 0_M$; this follows because $M \subset R$ means that we can take $\alpha_1 = -m_2, \alpha_2 = m_1$. This contradicts the assumption that $B$ was a basis, so we must have $\abs{B} = 1$ and so $B = \theset{\vector m}$ for some $\vector m \in I$. But then $M = \generators{B} = \generators{\vector m}$ is generated by a single element, so $M$ is principal.

    $\impliedby$:

    Suppose $M\normal R$ is principal, so $M = \generators{\vector m}$ for some $\vector m \neq \vector{0}_M \in M \subset R$.

    Then $x\in M \implies x = \alpha\vector m$ for some element $\alpha\in R$ and we just need to show that $\alpha\vector m = \vector 0_M \implies \alpha = 0_R$ in order for $\theset{\vector m}$ to be a basis for $M$, making $M$ a free $R\dash$module.

    But since $M \subset R$, we have $\alpha, m \in R$ and $\vector 0_M = 0_R$, and since $R$ is an integral domain, we have $\alpha m = 0_R \implies \alpha = 0_R$ or $m = 0_R$.

    Since $m \neq 0_R$, this forces $\alpha = 0_R$, which allows $\theset{m}$ to be a linearly independent set and thus a basis for $M$ as an $R\dash$module.

## Minimal / Characteristic Polynomials

Fix some notation:
\begin{align*}
\min_A(x): \quad & \text{The minimal polynomial of } A \\
\chi_A(x): \quad & \text{The characteristic polynomial of } A
.\end{align*}

Definition
: The *minimal polynomial* of a linear morphism is the unique monic polynomial $\min_A(x)$ of minimal degree such that $\min_A(A) = 0$.

Definition
: The **characteristic polynomial** of $A$ is given by
$$
\chi_A(x) = \det(A - xI))= \det(SNF(A - xI))
.$$

Lemma
: If $A$ is upper triangular, then $\det(A) = \prod_{i} a_{ii}$



Theorem (Cayley-Hamilton)
: The minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, and in particular $\chi_A(A) = 0$.

Proof
:   By Cayley-Hamilton, $\min_A$ divides $\chi_A$. 
    Every $\lambda_i$ is a root of $\mu_M$: 

    Let $(\vector v_i, \lambda_i)$ be a nontrivial eigenpair. 
    Then by linearity,
    $$
    \min_A(\lambda_i)\vector v_i = \min_A(A)\vector v_i = \vector 0
    ,$$ 
    which forces $\min_A(\lambda_i) = 0$.

Definition (Similar Matrices)
: Two matrices $A,B$ are **similar** (i.e. $A = PBP\inv$) $\iff A,B$ have the same Jordan Canonical Form (JCF).

Definition (Equivalent Matrices)
:   Two matrices $A, B$ are **equivalent** (i.e. $A = PBQ$) $\iff$

    - They have the same rank,

    - They have the same invariant factors, *and*

    - They have the same (JCF)

## Finding Minimal Polynomials

Let $m(x)$ denote the minimal polynomial $A$.

1. Find the characteristic polynomial $\chi(x)$; this annihilates $A$ by Cayley-Hamilton. Then $m(x) \divides \chi(x)$, so just test the finitely many products of irreducible factors.

2. Pick any $\vector v$ and compute $T\vector v, T^2\vector v, \cdots T^k\vector v$ until a linear dependence is introduced. Write this as $p(T) = 0$; then $\min_A(x) \divides p(x)$.

Definition (Companion Matrix)
:   Given a monic $p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + x^n$, the **companion matrix** of $p$ is given by
    \begin{align*}
    C_p \definedas 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 & \dots & 0 &-a_0 \\ 
    1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & -a_1 \\ 
    0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & -a_2 \\ 
    \vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots \\ 
    0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & -a_{n-1} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    .\end{align*}

## Canonical Forms

### Rational Canonical Form

Corresponds to the **Invariant Factor Decomposition** of $T$.

Theorem (Structure Theorem)
: For $R$ a PID and $M$ a finitely-generated $R\dash$module, there exists an invariant factor decomposition
\begin{align*}
M \cong R^r \bigoplus_{i=1}^\ell R/(a_i) \quad a_1 \divides a_2 \divides \cdots \divides a_\ell
\end{align*}
where each $a_i$ is an invariant factor.

Proposition
: Each $a_i$ corresponds

Proposition (RCF Relates to Invariant Factors)
: $RCF(A)$ is a block matrix where each block is the companion matrix of an invariant factor of $A$.

Proof
:   The derivation:

    - Let $k[x] \actson V$ using $T$, makes $V$ into a $k[x]\dash$module. 

    - $k$ a field implies $k[x]$ a PID, so apply structure theorem to obtain invariant factors $a_i$,

    - Note that $T\actson V$ by multiplication by $x$

    - Write $\bar x = \pi(x)$ where $F[x] \mapsvia{\pi} F[x]/(a_i)$; then $\spanof\theset{\overline x} = F[x]/(a_i)$.

    - Write $a_i(x) = \sum b_i x^i$, note that $V \to F[x]$ pushes $T\actson V$ to $T\actson k[x]$ by multiplication by $\overline x$

    - WRT the basis $\overline x$, $T$ then acts via the companion matrix on this summand.

    - Each invariant factor corresponds to a block of the RCF.

### Jordan Canonical Form

Corresponds to the **Elementary Divisor Decomposition** of $T$.

Lemma
: The elementary divisors of $A$ are the minimal polynomials of the Jordan blocks.

Lemma (JCF from Minimal and Characteristic Polynomials)
:   Writing $\spec(A) = \theset{(\lambda_i, b_i)}$,
    \begin{align*}
    \min_A(x) = \prod (x- \lambda_i)^{a_i} \\
    \chi_A(x) = \prod (x- \lambda_i)^{b_i}
    \end{align*}

    - The roots both polynomials are precisely the eigenvalues of $A$

    - The spectrum of $A$ corresponds precisely to the **characteristic** polynomial 
    
    - $a_i \leq b_i$

    - $a_i$ is the size of the **largest** Jordan block associated to $\lambda_i$,

    - $b_i$ is the **sum of sizes** of all Jordan blocks associated to $\lambda_i$ and the number of times $\lambda_i$ appears on the diagonal of $JCF(A)$.

    - $\dim E_{\lambda_i}$ is the **number of Jordan blocks** associated to $\lambda_i$

## Using Canonical Forms

Lemma
:   The characteristic polynomial is the *product of the invariant factors*, i.e.
    $$
    \chi_A(x) = \prod_{j=1}^n f_j(x)
    .$$

Lemma
:   The minimal polynomial of $A$ is the *invariant factor of highest degree*, i.e.
    $$
    \min_A(x) = f_n(x)
    .$$

Lemma
:   For a linear operator on a vector space of nonzero finite dimension, TFAE:

    - The minimal polynomial is equal to the characteristic polynomial.

    - The list of invariant factors has length one.

    - The Rational Canonical Form has a single block.

    - The operator has a matrix similar to a companion matrix.

    - There exists a *cyclic vector* $\vector v$ such that $\spanof_k\theset{T^j \vector v \suchthat j = 1, 2, \cdots} = V.$

    - $T$ has $\dim V$ distinct eigenvalues

## Diagonalizability

*Notation:*
$A^*$ denotes the conjugate tranpose of $A$.

Lemma
:   Let $V$ be a vector space over $k$ an algebraically closed and $A \in \mathrm{End}(V)$.
    Then if $W \subseteq V$ is an invariant subspace, so $A(W) \subseteq W$, the $A$ has an eigenvector in $W$.

Theorem (The Spectral Theorem)
:   Statements:

    1. Hermitian matrices (i.e. $A^* = A$) are diagonalizable over $\CC$.
    2. Symmetric matrices (i.e. $A^t = A$) are diagonalizable over $\RR$.

Proof
:   \hfill

    - Suppose $A$ is Hermitian.
    - Since $V$ itself is an invariant subspace, $A$ has an eigenvector $\vector v_1 \in V$.
    - Let $W_1 = \spanof_k\theset{\vector v_1}^\perp$.
    - Then for any $\vector w_1 \in W_1$, 
    $$
    \inner{\vector v_1}{ A \vector w_1} =
    \inner{A \vector v_1}{\vector w_1} =
    \lambda \inner{\vector v_1}{\vector w_1} = 0,
    $$
    so $A(W_1) \subseteq W_1$ is an invariant subspace, etc.

    - Suppose now that $A$ is symmetric.
    - Then there is an eigenvector of norm 1, $\vector v \in V$.
    \begin{align*}
    \lambda = \lambda\inner{\vector v}{\vector v} = \inner{A\vector v}{\vector v} = \inner{\vector v}{A\vector v} = \overline{\lambda} \implies \lambda \in \RR
    .\end{align*}


Proposition (Simultaneous Diagonalizability)
:   A set of operators $\theset{A_i}$ pairwise commute $\iff$ they are all simultaneously diagonalizable.


Proof
:   By induction on number of operators

    - $A_n$ is diagonalizable, so $V = \bigoplus E_i$ a sum of eigenspaces
    - Restrict all $n-1$ operators $A$ to $E_n$.
    - The commute in $V$ so they commute in $E_n$
    - **(Lemma)** They were diagonalizable in $V$, so they're diagonalizable in $E_n$
    - So they're simultaneously diagonalizable by I.H.
    - But these eigenvectors for the $A_i$ are all in $E_n$, so they're eigenvectors for $A_n$ too.
    - Can do this for each eigenspace.

Theorem (Characterizations of Diagonalizability)
:  $M$ is diagonalizable over $\FF \iff \min_M(x, \FF)$ splits into distinct linear factors over $\FF$, or equivalently iff all of the roots of $\min_M$ lie in $\FF$.

Proof
:   $\implies$:
    If $\min_A$ factors into linear factors, so does each invariant factor, so every elementary divisor is linear and $JCF(A)$ is diagonal.

    $\impliedby$:
    If $A$ is diagonalizable, every elementary divisor is linear, so every invariant factor factors into linear pieces. 
    But the minimal polynomial is just the largest invariant factor.

## Matrix Counterexamples

1. A matrix that:

- Is not diagonalizable over $\RR$ but diagonalizable over $\CC$

- Has *no* eigenvalues over $\RR$ but has *distinct* eigenvalues over $\CC$

- $\min_M(x) = \chi_M(x) = x^2 + 1$

\begin{align*}
M = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0  & 1 \\
-1 & 0
\end{array}\right] \sim
\left[\begin{array}{r|r}
-1 \sqrt{-1} & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 1 \sqrt{-1}
\end{array}\right]
.\end{align*}


2.
\begin{align*}
M = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right] \sim
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
.\end{align*}

- Not diagonalizable over $\CC$

- Eigenvalues $[1, 1]$ (repeated, multiplicity 2)

- $\min_M(x) = \chi_M(x) = x^2-2x+1$

3. Non-similar matrices with the same characteristic polynomial

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ll}
{1}  & {0} \\
{0} & {1}
 \end{array}\right]
 \text { and }
 \left[\begin{array}{ll}
 {1} & {1} \\
 {0} & {1}
  \end{array}\right]
$$

4. A full-rank matrix that is not diagonalizable:
\begin{align*}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\end{align*}

1. Matrix roots of unity:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{I_2} =
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
.\end{align*}

\begin{align*} \sqrt{-I_2} =
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
.\end{align*}

Lemma
: Every $a\in R$ for a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor.

Proof
: Let $a\in R$ and define $\phi(x) = ax$.
  If $\phi$ is injective, then it is surjective, so $1 = ax$ for some $x \implies x\inv = a$.
  Otherwise, $ax_1 = ax_2$ with $x_1 \neq x_2 \implies a(x_1 - x_2) = 0$ and $x_1 - x_2 \neq 0$, so $a$ is a zero divisor.

Lemma
: Maximal $\implies$ prime, but generally not the converse.

Proof
:   Suppose $\mm$ is maximal, $ab\in \mm$, and $b\not\in \mm$.
    Then there is a containment of ideals $\mm \subsetneq \mm + (b) \implies \mm + (b) = R$.

    So
    $$
    1 = m + rb \implies a = am + r(ab)
    ,$$
    but $am\in \mm$ and $ab\in \mm \implies a\in \mm$.


*Counterexample*: $(0) \in \ZZ$ is prime since $\ZZ$ is a domain, but not maximal since it is properly contained in any other ideal.

Lemma
: The nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals, i.e.
  $$
  \mathfrak{N}(R) = \intersect_{\mathfrak{p} \in \spec(R)} \mathfrak{p}
  $$

Proof
:   $\mathfrak{N} \subseteq \intersect \mathfrak{p}$:
    $x \in \mathfrak{N} \implies x^n = 0 \in \mathfrak p \implies x\in \mathfrak{p} \text{ or } x^{n-1}\in\mathfrak p$.

    $\mathfrak{N}^c \subseteq \union \mathfrak{p}^c$:
    Define $S = \theset{I\normal R \suchthat a^n\not\in I \text{ for any } n}$.
    Then apply Zorn's lemma to get a maximal ideal $\mm$, and maximal $\implies$ prime.

Lemma
: $R/\mathfrak \nilrad(R)$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements.

Proof
:   \hfill
    \begin{align*}
    a + \mathfrak N(R)\text{ nilpotent } &\implies (a+ \mathfrak N(R))^n \definedas a^n + \mathfrak N(R)= \mathfrak N(R) \\
    &\implies a^n \in \mathfrak N(R) \\
    &\implies \exists \ell \text{ such that } (a^n)^\ell = 0 \\
    &\implies a\in \mathfrak N(R)
    .\end{align*}

Lemma
: $\mathfrak \nilrad (R) \subseteq \jacobsonrad(R)$.

Proof
: Maximal $\implies$ prime, and so if $x$ is in every prime ideal, it is necessarily in every maximal ideal as well.
