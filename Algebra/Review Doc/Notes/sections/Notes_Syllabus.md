> As a general rule, students are responsible for knowing both the theory (proofs) and practical
applications (e.g. **how to find the Jordan or rational canonical form** of a given matrix, **or the
Galois group of a given polynomial**) of the topics mentioned.

# Remarks

> Adapted from remark written by Roy Smith, August 2006

## Group theory:

The first 6 chapters (220 pages) of DF are excellent.

All the definitions and proofs of these theorems on groups are given in Smith's web based lecture notes for math 843 part 1.

**Key topics:**

- Sylow theorems

- Simplicity of $A_n$ for $n > 4$.

- The first isomorphism theorem,

- The Jordan Holder theorem,

> The last two (one easy, one hard) are left as exercises.

**The proof JH is seldom tested on the qual**, but proofs are always of interest.

- Fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups

  *DF Exercises 12.1.16-19*

- The simple groups of order between 60 and 168 have prime order


## Rings:


- DF Chapters 7,8,9.

- Gauss's important theorem on unique factorization of polynomials:
  - $\ZZ[x]$ is a UFD
  - $R[x]$ is a UFD when $R$ is a UFD

- The fundamental isomorphism theorems for rings (easy and useful exercise)

- How to use Zorn's lemma
  - To find maximal ideals
  - Construct algebraic field closures
  - Why it is unnecessary in countable or noetherian rings.

  > Smith discusses extensively in 844-1.

- Results about PIDs

  (DF Section 8.2)

  - Example of a PID that is not a Euclidean domain

    *(DF p.277)*

  - Proof that a Euclidean domain is a PID and hence a UFD

  - Proof that $\ZZ$ and $k[x]$ are UFDs

    *(p.289 Smith, p.300 DF)*

- A polynomial ring in infinitely many variables over a UFD is still a ufd

  *(Easy, DF, p.305)*

- Eisenstein's criterion

  *(DF p.309)*

  - Stated only for monic polynomials -- proof of general case identical.

  - See Smith's notes for the  full version.

- Cyclic product structure of $(\ZZ/n\ZZ)\units$

  *(exercise in DF, Smith 844-2, section 18)*

- Grobner bases and division algorithms for polynomials in several variables

  *(DF 9.6.)*

- Modules over pid's and Canonical forms of matrices.

  *DF sections 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, and 12.1, 12.2, 12.3.*

  - Constructive proof of decomposition: DF Exercises 12.1.16-19

  - Smith 845-1 and 845-2:
  Detailed discussion of the constructive proof.

## Field Theory / Galois Theory.
