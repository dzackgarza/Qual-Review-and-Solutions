# Topics and Remarks 2

> Adapted from remark written by Roy Smith, August 2006

> "As a general rule, students are responsible for knowing both the theory (proofs) and practical
applications (e.g. **how to find the Jordan or rational canonical form** of a given matrix, **or the
Galois group of a given polynomial**) of the topics mentioned."

## Group Theory

> "The first 6 chapters (220 pages) of Dummit and Foote are excellent.
All the definitions and proofs of these theorems on groups are given in Smith's web based lecture notes for math 843 part 1."

**Key Topics:**

- Sylow theorems

- Simplicity of $A_n$ for $n > 4$.

- The first isomorphism theorem,

- The Jordan Holder theorem,

  > The last two (one easy, one hard) are left as exercises.

  **The proof of Jordan-Holder is seldom tested on the qual**, but proofs are always of interest.

- Fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups

  *DF Exercises 12.1.16-19*

- The simple groups of order between 60 and 168 have prime order
