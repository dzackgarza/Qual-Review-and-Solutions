# Topics and Remarks 2

:::{.remark}
Adapted from remark written by Roy Smith, August 2006:

As a general rule, students are responsible for knowing both the theory (proofs) and practical
applications (e.g. **how to find the Jordan or rational canonical form** of a given matrix, **or the Galois group of a given polynomial**) of the topics mentioned.
