# Modules

## General Modules


:::{.definition title="Simple Module"}
A module is **simple** iff it has no nontrivial proper submodules.
:::


:::{.definition title="Free Module"}
A **free** module is a module with a basis (i.e. a spanning, linearly independent set).
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
$\ZZ/(6)$ is a $\ZZ\dash$module that is *not* free.
:::



:::{.definition title="Projective Modules"}
A module $M$ is **projective** iff $M$ is a direct summand of a free module $F = M \oplus \cdots$.
:::



:::{.example title="?"}
Free implies projective, but not the converse.
:::




Definition (Exact Sequences)
: A sequence of module morphisms $0 \mapsvia{d_1} A \mapsvia{d_2} B \mapsvia{d_3} C \to 0$ is *exact* iff $\im d_i = \ker d_{i+1}$.

Proposition (Splitting Exact Sequences)
:   If $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ is a short exact sequence, then

    - $C$ free $\implies$ the sequence splits
    - $C$ projective $\implies$ the sequence splits
    - $A$ injective $\implies$ the sequence splits

    Moreover, if this sequence splits, then $B \cong A \oplus C$.

## Classification of Modules over a PID

Let $M$ be a finitely generated modules over a PID $R$.
Then there is an invariant factor decomposition

\begin{align*}
M \cong F \bigoplus R/(r_i) \quad\text{where } r_1 \divides r_2 \divides \cdots
,\end{align*}

and similarly an elementary divisor decomposition.

Proposition (Principal Ideals are Free)
: $I \normal R$ is a free $R\dash$module iff $I$ is a principal ideal.

Proof
:   $\implies$:

    Suppose $I$ is free as an $R\dash$module, and let $B = \theset{\vector m_j}_{j\in J} \subseteq I$ be a basis so we can write $M = \generators{B}$.

    Suppose that $\abs{B} \geq 2$, so we can pick at least 2 basis elements $\vector m_1\neq \vector m_2$, and consider
    $$
    \vector c = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_2 \vector m_1,
    $$

    which is also an element of $M$ .

    Since $R$ is an integral domain, $R$ is commutative, and so
    $$
    \vector c = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_2 \vector m_1 = \vector m_1 \vector m_2 - \vector m_1 \vector m_2 = \vector 0_M
    $$

    However, this exhibits a linear dependence between $\vector m_1$ and $\vector m_2$, namely that there exist $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \neq 0_R$ such that $\alpha_1 \vector m_1 + \alpha_2 \vector m_2 = \vector 0_M$; this follows because $M \subset R$ means that we can take $\alpha_1 = -m_2, \alpha_2 = m_1$. This contradicts the assumption that $B$ was a basis, so we must have $\abs{B} = 1$ and so $B = \theset{\vector m}$ for some $\vector m \in I$. But then $M = \generators{B} = \generators{\vector m}$ is generated by a single element, so $M$ is principal.

    $\impliedby$:

    Suppose $M\normal R$ is principal, so $M = \generators{\vector m}$ for some $\vector m \neq \vector{0}_M \in M \subset R$.

    Then $x\in M \implies x = \alpha\vector m$ for some element $\alpha\in R$ and we just need to show that $\alpha\vector m = \vector 0_M \implies \alpha = 0_R$ in order for $\theset{\vector m}$ to be a basis for $M$, making $M$ a free $R\dash$module.

    But since $M \subset R$, we have $\alpha, m \in R$ and $\vector 0_M = 0_R$, and since $R$ is an integral domain, we have $\alpha m = 0_R \implies \alpha = 0_R$ or $m = 0_R$.

    Since $m \neq 0_R$, this forces $\alpha = 0_R$, which allows $\theset{m}$ to be a linearly independent set and thus a basis for $M$ as an $R\dash$module.
