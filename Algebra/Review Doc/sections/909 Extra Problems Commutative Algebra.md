## Commutative Algebra

- Show that a finitely generated module over a Noetherian local ring is flat iff it is free using Nakayama and Tor.

- Show that \( \gens{ 2, x }\normal \ZZ[x]  \) is not a principal ideal.

- Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring and $A,B$ algebras over $R$. 
  Suppose $A$ is finite type over $R$ and finite over B. 
  Then $B$ is finite type over $R$.
