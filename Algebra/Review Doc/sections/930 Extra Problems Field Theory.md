## Field Theory

General Algebra

- Show that any finite integral domain is a field.
- Show that every field is simple.
- Show that any field morphism is either 0 or injective.
- Show that if $L/F$ and $\alpha$ is algebraic over both $F$ and $L$, then the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $L$ divides the minimal polynomial over $F$.
- Prove that if $R$ is an integral domain, then $R[t]$ is again an integral domain.
- Show that $ff(R[t]) = ff(R)(t)$.
- Show that $[\QQ(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3) : \QQ] = 4$.
  - Show that $\QQ(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3) = \QQ(\sqrt 2 - \sqrt 3) = \QQ(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3)$.
- Show that the splitting field of $f(x) = x^3-2$ is $\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_2)$.

Extensions?

- What is $[\QQ(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3): \QQ]$?
- What is $[\QQ(2^{3\over 2}) : \QQ]$?
- Show that if $p\in \QQ[x]$ and $r\in \QQ$ is a rational root, then in fact $r\in \ZZ$.
- If $\theset{\alpha_i}_{i=1}^n \subset F$ are algebraic over $K$, show that $K[\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n] = K(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n)$.
- Show that $\alpha/F$ is algebraic $\iff F(\alpha)/F$ is a finite extension.
- Show that every finite field extension is algebraic.
- Show that if $\alpha, \beta$ are algebraic over $F$, then $\alpha\pm \beta, \alpha\beta^{\pm 1}$ are all algebraic over $F$.
- Show that if $L/K/F$ with $K/F$ algebraic and $L/K$ algebraic then $L$ is algebraic.

Special Polynomials

- Show that a field with $p^n$ elements has exactly one subfield of size $p^d$ for every $d$ dividing $n$.
- Show that $x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$.
- Show that $x^{p^d} - x \divides x^{p^n} - x \iff d \divides n$
- Prove that $x^{p^n}-x$ is the product of all monic irreducible polynomials in $\FF_p[x]$ with degree dividing $n$.
- Prove that an irreducible $\pi(x)\in \FF_p[x]$ divides $x^{p^n}-x \iff \deg \pi(x)$ divides $n$.
