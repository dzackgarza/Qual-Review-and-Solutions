## Modules and Linear Algebra

- Prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.
- Prove that the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial.
- Prove that the cokernel of $A\in \mat(n\times n, \ZZ)$ is finite $\iff \det A \neq 0$, and show that in this case $\abs{\coker(A)} = \abs{\det(A)}$.
- Show that a nilpotent operator is diagonalizable.
- Show that if $A,B$ are diagonalizable and $[A, B] = 0$ then $A,B$ are simultaneously diagonalizable.
- Does diagonalizable imply invertible? The converse?
- Does diagonalizable imply distinct eigenvalues?
- Show that if a matrix is diagonalizable, its minimal polynomial is squarefree.
- Show that a matrix representing a linear map $T:V\to V$ is diagonalizable iff $V$ is a direct sum of eigenspaces $V = \bigoplus_i \ker(T -\lambda_i I)$.
- Show that if $\theset{\vector v_i}$ is a basis for $V$ where $\dim(V) = n$ and $T(\vector v_i) = \vector v_{i+1 \mod n}$ then $T$ is diagonalizable with minimal polynomial $x^n-1$.
- Show that if the minimal polynomial of a linear map $T$ is irreducible, then every $T\dash$invariant subspace has a $T\dash$invariant complement.
