## Field Theory

1. What is $[\QQ(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3): \QQ]$?
2. What is $[\QQ(2^{3\over 2}) : \QQ]$?
3. Show that every field is simple.
4. Show that any field morphism is either 0 or injective.
5. Show that if $p\in \QQ[x]$ and $r\in \QQ$ is a rational root, then in fact $r\in \ZZ$.
6. If $\theset{\alpha_i}_{i=1}^n \subset F$ are algebraic over $K$, show that $K[\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n] = K(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n)$.
7. Show that the Galois group of $x^n - 2$ is $D_n$, the dihedral group on $n$ vertices.
8. Compute all intermediate field extensions of $\QQ(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3)$, show it is equal to $\QQ(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)$, and find a corresponding minimal polynomial.
