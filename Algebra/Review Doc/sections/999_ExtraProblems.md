## Group Theory

### Basic Structure


- Show that any cyclic group is abelian.
- Show that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian.
- Show that the intersection of two subgroups is again a subgroup.
- Show that if $G \actson X$ is a group action, then the stabilizer $G_x$ of a point is a subgroup.
- Show that $G=H\cross K$ iff the conditions for recognizing direct products hold.
- Show that if $H, K \normal G$ and $H\intersect K = \emptyset$, then $hk=kh$ for all $h\in H,k\in K$.
- Show that every normal subgroup of $G$ is contained in $Z(G)$.
- Show that $\abs{G}/\abs{H} = [G: H]$.
- Show that the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group.
- Show that $\phi(n) = n \prod{p\mid n}\qty{1 - {1\over p}}$.
- Show that $Z(G) \subseteq C_G(H) \subseteq N_G(H)$.
- Show that $G/N$ is abelian iff $[G, G] \leq N$.
- Give a counterexample where $H,K\leq G$ but $HK$ is not a subgroup of $G$.
- Show that if $H,K\normal G$ are normal subgroups that intersect trivially, then $[H, K] = 1$ (so $hk = kh$ for all $k$ and $h$).
- Give an example showing that normality is not transitive: i.e. $H\normal K \normal G$ with $H$ *not* normal in $G$.
- Show that the size of a conjugacy class divides the order of a group.
- Show that $C_G(H) \subseteq N_G(H) \leq G$.
- Given $H\subseteq G$, let $S(H)= \bigcup_{g\in G} gHg^{-1}$, so $\abs{S(H)}$ is the number of conjugates to $H$. 
  Show that $\abs{S(H)} = [G : N_G(H)]$.
  - That is, the number of subgroups conjugate to $H$ equals the index of the normalizer of $H$.

- Show that $Z(G) = \bigcap_{a\in G} C_G(a)$.

- Show that the centralizer $G_G(H)$ of a subgroup is again a subgroup.

- Show that $C_G(H) \normal N_G(H)$ is a normal subgroup.

- Show that $C_G(G) = Z(G)$.

- Show that for $H\leq G$, $C_H(x) = H \intersect C_G(x)$.

- Let $H, K \leq G$ a finite group, and without using the normalizers of $H$ or $K$, show that $\abs{HK} = \abs{H} \abs{K}/\abs{H\intersect K}$.

- Show that if $\abs{G} = 12$ and has a normal subgroup of order 4, then $G \cong A_4$.


### Nonstandard Topics

- Show that $H~\text{char}~G \Rightarrow H \unlhd G$
  
  > Thus "characteristic" is a strictly stronger condition than normality

- Show that $H ~\text{char}~ K ~\text{char}~G \Rightarrow H ~\text{char}~ G$
  
  > So "characteristic" is a transitive relation for subgroups.

- Show that if $H \leq G$, $K\normal G$ is a normal subgroup, and $H~\text{char}~K$ then $H$ is normal in  $G$.

  > So normality is not transitive, but strengthening one to "characteristic" gives a weak form of transitivity.
