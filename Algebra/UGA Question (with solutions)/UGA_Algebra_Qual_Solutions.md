# Preface

I'd like to extend my gratitude to the following people for helping supply solutions and proofs:

- Paco Adajar
- Swaroop Hegde

Many other solutions contain input and ideas from other graduate students and faculty members at UGA, along with questions and answers posted on Math Stack Exchange or Math Overflow.

# Group Theory: General

## Cosets

### Spring 2020 #2 $\done$
Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of a finite group $G$ where the order of $H$ and the index of $H$ in $G$ are relatively prime.
Prove that no other subgroup of $G$ has the same order as $H$.

:::{.concept}
\envlist

- Division algorithm: $(a,b)= d\implies as+bt =1$ for some $s, t$.
- Coset containment trick: $X\subseteq N \iff xN = N$ for all $x$.
:::

:::{.strategy}
Recognize that it suffices to show $hN = N$.
Context cue: coprimality hints at division algorithm.
Descend to quotient so you can leverage both the order of $h$ *and* the order of cosets simultaneously.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- For ease of notation, replace $H$ in the problem with $N$ so we remember which one is normal.
- Write $n\da \# N$ and $m \da [G:N] = \#G/N$, where the quotient makes sense since $N$ is normal.
- Let $H \leq G$ with $\# H = n$, we'll show $H=N$.
  - Since $\# H = \# N$ it suffices to show $H \subseteq N$.
  - It further suffices to show $hN = N$ for all $h\in H$.
- Noting $\gcd(m, n)=1$, use the division algorithm to write $1 = ns + mt$ for some $s,t\in \ZZ$.
- The result follows from a computation:
\[
hN 
&= h^1 N \\
&= h^{ns + mt}N \\
&= h^{ns} N \cdot h^{mt}N \\
&= \qty{h^n N}^s \cdot \qty{h^t N}^m \\
&= (eN)^s \cdot N \\
&= N
,\]
  - We've used that $h\in H \implies o(h) \divides \# H = n$ by Lagrange, so $h^n = e$.
  - We've also used that $\# G/N = m$, so $(xH)^m = H$ for any $xH\in G/H$.

:::

### Fall 2014 #6 $\done$
Let $G$ be a group and $H, K < G$ be subgroups of finite index.
Show that
\[
[G: H\intersect K] \leq [G: H] ~ [G:K]
.\]


:::{.concept}
\envlist

- For $H, K\leq G$, intersection is again a subgroup of everything: $H\intersect K \leq H, K, G$ by the one-step subgroup test.
- Counting in towers: $A\leq B \leq C \implies [C:A] = [C:B][B:A]$.
- Fundamental theorem of cosets: $xH = yH \iff xy\inv \in H$.
- Common trick: just list out all of the darn cosets!

:::

:::{.strategy}
Count in towers, show that distinct coset reps stay distinct.

:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- $H \intersect K \leq H \leq G \implies [G: H \intersect K] = [G: H] [H : H \intersect K]$
- So it suffices to show $[H: H \intersect K] \leq [G: K]$
- Write $H/H \intersect K = \ts{ h_1 J, \cdots, h_m J }$ as distinct cosets where $J \da H \intersect J$.
- Then $h_i J\neq h_j J \iff h_i h_j\inv \not\in J = H \intersect K$.
- $H$ is a subgroup, so $h_i h_j\inv \in H$ forces this not to be in $K$.
- But then $h_i K \neq h_j K$, so these are distinct cosets in $G/K$.
- So $\#G/K \geq m$.
:::

### Spring 2013 #3 $\done$
Let $P$ be a finite $p\dash$group.
Prove that every nontrivial normal subgroup of $P$ intersects the center of $P$ nontrivially.

\todo[inline]{Clean up, sketchy argument.}

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- Let $N\normal P$, then for each conjugacy class $[n_i]$ in $N$, $H \intersect [g_i] = [g_i]$ or is empty.
- $G = \disjoint_{i\leq M} [g_i]$ is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes, and the conjugacy classes of $H$ are of the form $[g_i] \intersect H$.
- Then pull out the center
\[
H = \Disjoint_{i\leq M} [g_i] \intersect H = \qty{ Z(G) \intersect H } \disjoint \Disjoint_{i\leq M'} [g_i]
.\]
- Taking cardinalities, 
\[
\# H = \# \qty{ Z(G) \intersect H} + \sum_{i\leq M'} \# [g_i]
.\]
- $p$ divides $H$ since $H\leq P$ and $P$ is a $p\dash$group.
- Each $\# [g_i] \geq 2$ since the trivial conjugacy classes appear in the center, forcing $\# [g_i] \geq p$.
- $p$ divides $\# [g_i]$ since $\# [g_i]$ must divide $\# P = p^k$
- So $p$ must divide the remaining term $Z(G) \intersect H$, which makes it nontrivial.

:::


## Burnside / Class Equation

### Spring 2019 #4 $\done$
For a finite group $G$, let $c(G)$ denote the number of conjugacy classes of $G$.

a.
Prove that if two elements of $G$ are chosen uniformly at random,then the probability they commute is precisely
$$
\frac{c(G)}{\abs G}
.$$

b.
State the class equation for a finite group.

c.
Using the class equation (or otherwise) show that the probability in part (a) is at most $$
\frac 1 2 + \frac 1 {2[G : Z(G)]}
.$$

> Here, as usual, $Z(G)$ denotes the center of $G$.

:::{.warnings}
(DZG) This is a slightly anomalous problem!
It's fun and worth doing, because it uses the major counting formulas.
Just note that the techniques used in this problem perhaps don't show up in other group theory problems.
:::

:::{.concept}
\envlist

- Notation: $X/G$ is the set of $G\dash$orbits
- Notation: $X^g = \theset{x\in X\suchthat g\cdot x = x}$
- Burnside's formula: $\#{X/G} = {1 \over \# G} \sum \# {X^g}$.
- Definition of conjugacy class: $C(g) = \ts{ hgh\inv \st h\in G }$.
:::

:::{.strategy}
Fixed points of the conjugation action are precisely commuting elements.
Apply Burnside.
Context clue: $1/[G:Z(G)]$ is weird, right? 
Use that $[G:Z(G)] = \# G/\# Z(G)$, so try to look for $\#Z(G)/\#(G)$ somewhere.
Count sizes of centralizers.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

:::{.proof title="Part a"}
\envlist

- Define a sample space $\Omega = G \cross G$, so $\# {\Omega} = (\# {G})^2$.

- Identify the event we want to analyze: 
\[
A \definedas \theset{(g,h) \in G\cross G \suchthat [g,h] = 1} \subseteq \Omega
.\]
- Note that the slices are centralizers:
\[
A_g \definedas \theset{(g, h) \in \ts{ g } \cross G \suchthat [g, h] = 1} = Z(g) \implies A = \Disjoint_{g\in G} Z(g)
.\]

- Set $n$ be the number of conjugacy classes, note we want to show $P(A) = n / \abs{G}$.
 
- Let $G$ act on itself by conjugation, which partitions $G$ into conjugacy classes.

  - What are the orbits? 
  $$
  \mathcal{O}_g = \theset{hgh\inv \suchthat h\in G}
  ,$$ 
  which is the **conjugacy class** of $g$.
  In particular, the number of orbits is the number of conjugacy classes.

  - What are the fixed points? 
  $$X^g = \theset{h\in G \suchthat hgh\inv = g},$$ 
  which are the elements of $G$ that commute with $g$, which is isomorphic to $A_g$.


- Identifying centralizers with fixed points, 
  $$
  \#{A} = \#{\Disjoint_{g\in G} Z(g) } = \sum_{g\in G} \#{Z(g)} = \sum_{g\in G}\# {X^g}
  .$$


- Apply Burnside
$$
\# {X / G} = \frac { 1 } { \# G  } \sum _ { g \in G } \# X ^ { g } ,
$$
- Note $\#{X/G} = n$, i.e. the number of conjugacy classes is the number of orbits.
- Rearrange and use definition:
$$
n \cdot \#{G}
= \qty{\#{X/G} }\cdot \#{G}
= \sum _ { g \in G } \# X ^ { g } 
$$
- Compute probability:
\[
P(A)
= {\# A \over \# \Omega} 
= \Sum_{ g \in G } \frac{\# X ^ { g }}{ ( \# {G} )^2} 
= \frac{\qty{ \# {X/G}} \cdot \#{G}}{ (\#{G})^2} 
= \frac{n \cdot \#{G}}{( \#{G} )^2} 
= \frac n {\# G}
.\]

:::

:::{.proof title="Part b"}
Statement of the class equation:
\[
\abs G = Z(G) + \sum_{\substack{\text{One $x$ from each} \\ \text{conjugacy class}}}[G: Z(x)]
\]
where $Z(x) = \theset{g\in G \suchthat [g, x] = 1}$ is the centralizer of $x$ in $G$.
:::

:::{.proof title="Part c"}
\envlist

> (DZG): I couldn't convince myself that a previous proof using the class equation actually works.
> Instead, I'll borrow the proof from [this note](https://math.berkeley.edu/~tb65536/Commuting_Probability.pdf)

- Write the event as $A = \Disjoint_{g\in G} \ts{g} \cross Z(g)$, then
\[
P(A) 
= {\# A\over (\# G)^2} 
= {1\over (\# G)^2} \sum_{g\in G} \# Z(g)
.\]
- Attempt to estimate the sum: pull out central elements $g\in Z(G)$.
  - Note $Z(g) = G$ for central $g$, so $\# Z(g) = \# G$
  - Note 
  \[
  g\not\in Z(G)\implies \# Z(g) \leq {1\over 2} \# G
  ,\]
  since $Z(g) \leq G$ is a subgroup, and 
  \[
  [G:Z(g)] \neq 1 \implies [G: Z(g)] \geq 2
  .\]
- Use these facts to calculate:
\[
P(A) 
&= {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \sum_{g\in Z(g)} \# Z(g) + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} \# Z(g) } \\
&= {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \sum_{g\in Z(g)} \# G + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} \# Z(g) } \\
&= {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \# Z(G) \cdot \# G + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} \# Z(g) } \\
&\leq {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \# Z(G) \cdot \# G + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} {1\over 2} \# G } \\
&= {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \# Z(G) \cdot \# G + \qty{ \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} {1\over 2} } \cdot \# G } \\
&= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ \# Z(G) + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} {1\over 2} } \\
&= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ \# Z(G) + {1\over 2} \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} 1 } \\
&= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ \# Z(G) + {1\over 2} \#(G \sm Z(G) ) } \\
&= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ \# Z(G) + {1\over 2} \#G - {1\over 2} \# Z(G) } \\
&= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ {1\over 2} \# Z(G) + {1\over 2} \#G  } \\
&= {1\over 2} \qty{1 + { \# Z(G) \over \# G }} \\
&= {1\over 2} \qty{1 + { 1 \over [G : Z(G)]  }}
.\]

## Group Actions / Representations

### Spring 2017 #1 $\done$
Let $G$ be a finite group and $\pi: G\to \sym(G)$ the Cayley representation.

> (Recall that this means that for an element $x\in G$, $\pi(x)$ acts by left translation on $G$.)

Prove that $\pi(x)$ is an odd permutation $\iff$ the order $\abs{\pi(x)}$ of $\pi(x)$ is even and $\abs{G} / \abs{\pi(x)}$ is odd.

:::{.warnings}
(DZG): This seems like an unusually hard group theory problem.
My guess is this year's qual class spent more time than usual on the proof of Cayley's theorem.
:::

:::{.concept}
\envlist

- $\Sym(G) \da \Aut_\Set(G, G)$ is the group of set morphisms from $G$ to itself, i.e. permutations of elements of $G$.
- More standard terminology: this is related to the **left regular representation** where $g\mapsto \phi_g$ where $\phi_g(x) = gx$, regarded instead as a permutation representation.
  - This action is transitive!
- Cayley's theorem: every $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation group.
  In particular, take \( \ts{ \phi_g \st G\in G } \) with function composition as a subgroup of $\Aut_\Set(G)$.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

> (DZG): Warning!! I haven't checked this solution very carefully, and this is kind of a delicate parity argument.
  Most of the key ideas are borrowed [from here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3028603/show-that-phig-is-an-even-permutation).

- Write $k \da o(\pi_g)$, then since $\pi$ is injective, $k = o(g)$ in $G$.
- Since $\pi_g$ as a cycle is obtained from the action of $g$, we can pick an element $x_0$ in $G$, take the orbit under the action, and obtain a cycle of length $k$ since the order of $g$ is $k$.
  Then continue by taking any $x_1$ not in the first orbit and taking *its* orbit.
  Continuing this way exhausts all group elements and yields a decomposition into disjoint cycles:
\[
\pi_g = 
(x_0, gx_0, g^2 x_0, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_0)
(x_1, gx_1, g^2 x_1, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_1)
\cdots
(x_m, gx_m, g^2 x_m, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_m)
.\]
- So there are $m$ orbits all of length exactly $k$.
  Proceed by casework.
- If $k$ is even:
  - This yields $m$ odd cycles, and thus $\pi$ has zero (an even number) of even cycles.
  - Thus $\pi \in \ker \sgn$ and is an even permutation.
- If $k$ is odd
  - This yields $m$ even cycles, thus an even number of even cycles iff $m$ is even 
- The claim is that the number of orbit representatives $m$ is equal to $[G:H] = \# G/H$ for $H = \gens{ g }$. 
  - Proof: define a map
  \[
  \ts{ \text{Orbit representatives } x_i } &\to G/H \\
  x &\mapsto xH
  .\]
  - This is injective and surjective because
  \[
  xH = yH &\iff xy\inv \in H = \gens{ g } \\
  &\iff xy\inv = g^\ell \\
  &\iff x=g^\ell y \\
  &\iff y\in \OO_x
  ,\]
  so $y$ and $x$ are in the same orbit and have the same orbit representative.

- We now have
\[
\pi_g \text{ is an even permutation } \iff 
\begin{cases}
k \text{ is odd and } m \text{ is even} &  
\\
\text{ or } & \\
k \text{ is even}
 & .
\end{cases}
\]
- Everything was an iff, so flip the evens to odds:
\[
\pi_g \text{ is an odd permutation } \iff 
\begin{cases}
k \text{ is even and } m \text{ is odd} &  
\\
\text{ or } & \\
k \text{ is odd}
 & .
\end{cases}
.\]
- Then just recall that $k\da o(\pi_g)$ and 
\[
m= [G: \gens{ g }] = \# G / \# \gens{ g }= \# G / o(g) = \# G/ o(\pi_g)
.\]

### Fall 2015 #1 $\done$
Let $G$ be a group containing a subgroup $H$ not equal to $G$ of finite index.
Prove that $G$ has a normal subgroup which is contained in every conjugate of $H$ which is of finite index.

> (DZG) A remark: it's not the conjugates that should be finite index here, but rather the normal subgroup.

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- Let $H\leq G$ and define $n\da [G:H]$.
- Write $G/H = \ts{ x_1 H, \cdots, x_n H }$ for the finitely many cosets.
- Let $G$ act on $G/H$ by left translation, so $g\cdot xH \da gxH$..
  Call the action $\psi: G\to \Sym(G/H)$.
- Then $\Stab(xH) = xHx\inv$ is a subgroup conjugate to $H$, and $K\da \ker \psi = \Intersect_{i=1}^n xHx\inv$ is the intersection of all conjugates of $H$.
- Kernels are normal, so $K\normal G$, and $K\subseteq xHx\inv$ for all $x$, meaning $K$ is contained in every conjugate of $H$.
- The index $[G:K]$ is finite since $G/K \cong \im \psi$ by the first isomorphism theorem, and $\# \im \psi \leq \# \Sym(G/H) = \# S_n = n! < \infty$.

## Conjugacy Classes

### Spring 2021 #2 $\done$

Let $H \normal G$ be a normal subgroup of a finite group $G$, where the order of $H$ is the smallest prime $p$ dividing $\abs{G}$.
Prove that $H$ is contained in the center of $G$.

> Solution due to Swaroop Hegde, typed up + modifications added by DZG.

:::{.concept}
\envlist

- $x\in Z(G)$ iff $\# C_x = 1$, i.e. the size of its conjugacy class is one.
- Normal subgroups are disjoint unions of (some) conjugacy classes in $G$.
  - In fact, this is a characterization of normal subgroups (i.e. $H$ is normal iff $H$ is a union of conjugacy classes in $G$).
  - Why: if $H\normal G$ then $ghg\inv \in H$ for all $g$, so $C_h \subseteq H$ and $\Union_h C_h = H$.
  Conversely, if $H = \Union_{h\in H} C_h$, then $ghg\inv \in C_h \subseteq H$ and thus $gHg\inv = H$.
- Orbit stabilizer theorem: $\# C_g = \# G/ \# K_g$ where $C_g$ is the centralizer and $K_g$ is the conjugacy class of $g$.
  - In particular, $\# C_g$ divides $\#G$.

- Let \( \ts{ C_i }_{i\leq n} \) be the conjugacy classes in $G$, then $G = \disjoint_{i\leq n} C_i$
- By the first fact, there is a sub-collection \( \ts{ C_{i_j}}_{j\leq k } \)  such that 
\[
H = \disjoint_{j\leq k} C_{i_j}
.\]
- The identity is always in a single conjugacy class, so $C_e = \ts{ e }$.
- Since $e\in H$, without loss of generality, label $C_{i_1} = \ts{ e }$.
- So
\[
H 
= \Disjoint_{j\leq k} C_{i_j} 
= C_{i_1}{\textstyle  \coprod} \displaystyle\Disjoint_{\substack{ j\leq k \\ j\neq 1} } C_{i_j} 
.\]

- Take cardinality in the above equation 
\[
p = 1 + \sum_{\substack{ j\leq k \\ j\neq 1 }} \# C_{i_j}
.\]
- So $\# C_{i_j} \leq p-1$ for all $j\neq 1$.

- Every $\# C_{i_j}$ divides $\# G$, but $p$ was the *minimal* prime dividing $\# G$, forcing $\# C_{i_j} = 1$ for all $j \neq 1$.
  - This rules out $\# C_{i_j}$ being a prime less than $p$, but also rules out composites: if a prime $q\divides \# C_{i_j}$, then $q<p$ and $q\divides \# G$, a contradiction.

- By fact 3, each $x\in C_{i_j}$ satisfies $x\in Z(G)$.

- $\union C_{i_j} = H$, so $H \subseteq Z(G)$.

- A conjugacy class $[x]$ is trivial iff $[x] = \ts{ x }$ iff $x\in Z(G)$.
- Sizes of conjugacy classes divide the order of the group they live in.
  - This is orbit-stabilizer: $G\actson G$ by $g\cdot x \da gxg\inv$, so $\OO(x) = [x]$.

- Take cardinalities:
\[
p = \# N = \sum_{i=1}^m \# [n_i] = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^m [n_i]
.\]
- The size of each conjugacy class divides the size of $H$ by orbit-stabilizer, so $\# [n_i] \divides p$ for each $i$.
- But the entire second term must sum to $p-1$ for this equality to hold, which forces $\#[n_i] = 1$ (and incidentally $m=p-1$)
- Then $[n_i] = \ts{ n_i } \iff n_i \in Z(G)$, and this holds for all $i$, so $N \subseteq Z(G)$.

Important notations and definitions:

-   The **center** of $G$, denoted by $Z(G)$, is the subset of elements
    of $G$ which commute with all elements of $G$. That is, if
    $x \in Z(G)$, then for all $g \in G$, $gx = xg$:
    $$Z(G) = \{ x \in G : gx = xg \, \text{for all } g \in G \}.$$

    In fact, $Z(G)$ is not just a subset of $G$, but a normal subgroup
    of $G$.

-   The **commutator subgroup** of $G$, denoted by $[G, G]$, is the
    subgroup of $G$ generated by the commutators of $G$, i.e., the
    elements of the form $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$:
    $$[G, G] = \langle ghg^{-1}h^{-1} : g, h \in G \rangle.$$

    The commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the smallest normal subgroup of
    $G$ whose quotient is abelian. That is, if $H$ is a normal subgroup
    of $G$ for which $G/H$ is abelian, then $[G, G] \le H$.

    Moreover, $G$ is abelian if and only if $[G,G]$ is trivial.

Theorems to remember and know how to prove:

-   **$G/Z(G)$ Theorem**: If $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian,
    i.e., $G/Z(G)$ is in fact trivial.

-   **Lagrange's Theorem**: If $G$ is a group of finite order and $H$ is
    a subgroup of $G$, then the order of $H$ divides that of $G$.

    - One consequence of this is that every group of prime order is
    cyclic.

-   A $p$-group (a group of order $p^n$ for some prime $p$ and
    some positive integer $n$) has nontrivial center.

-   A consequence of the theorems above: every group of order $p^2$
    (where $p$ is prime) is abelian.

:::

:::{.solution}
Since $Z(G)$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $|G| = p^3$, by Lagrange's
theorem, $|Z(G)| \in \{1, p, p^2, p^3\}$.

Since we stipulated that $G$ is nonabelian, $|Z(G)| \ne p^3$. Also,
since $G$ is a $p$-group, it has nontrivial center, so $|Z(G)| \ne 1$.
Finally, by the $G/Z(G)$ theorem, $|Z(G)| \ne p^2$: if $|Z(G)| = p^2$,
then $|G/Z(G)| = p$ and so $G/Z(G)$ would be cyclic, meaning that $G$ is
abelian. Hence, $|Z(G)| = p$.

Then, since $|Z(G)| = p$, we have that $|G/Z(G)| = p^2$, and so $G/Z(G)$
is abelian. Thus, $[G, G] \in Z(G)$. Since $|Z(G)| = p$, then
$|[G,G]| \in \{ 1, p\}$ again by Lagrange's theorem. If $|[G,G]| = p$
then $[G,G] = Z(G)$ and we are done. And, indeed, we must have
$|[G,G]| = p$, because $G$ is nonabelian and so $|[G,G]| \ne 1$.

:::{.proof title="of a"}
\envlist

- By definition, $S\in \Syl_p(G) \iff S$ is a *maximal* $p\dash$subgroup: $S<G$ is a $p\dash$group, so $\#S = p^k$ for some $k$, $S$ is a proper subgroup, and $S$ is maximal in the sense that there are no proper $p\dash$subgroups $S'$ with $S \subseteq S' \subseteq G$.
- Since $\# H = p^i$, $H$ is a $p\dash$subgroup of $G$.
- If $H$ is maximal, then by definition $H\in \Syl_p(G)$
- Otherwise, if $H$ is not maximal, there exists an $H' \supseteq H$ with $H'\leq G$ a $p\dash$subgroup properly containing $H$.
  - In this apply the same argument to $H'$: this yields a proper superset containment at every stage, and since $G$ is finite, there is no infinite ascending chain of proper supersets.
  - So this terminates in some maximal $p\dash$subgroup $S$, i.e. a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.
- So $H \subseteq S$ for some $S\in \Syl_p(G)$.
- All Sylows are conjugate, so for any $S' \in \Syl_p(G)$ we can write $S' = gSg\inv$ for some $g$.
- Then using that $H$ is normal, $H \subseteq S \implies H = gHg\inv \subseteq gSg\inv \da S'$.
  So $H$ is contained in every Sylow $p\dash$subgroup.

:::

:::{.proof title="of b"}
\envlist

- Claim: $Z(H) \leq H$ works.
  - It is nontrivial since $H$ is a $p\dash$group and $p\dash$groups have nontrivial centers
  - It is abelian since $Z(Z(H)) = Z(H)$.
  - $\#Z(H) = p^\ell$ for some $\ell \leq i$ by Lagrange
- It thus remains to show that $Z(H) \normal G$.
- Use that $Z(H) \ch H$ and use transitivity of characteristic to conclude $Z(H) \normal H$.
- That $Z(H) \ch H$: let $\psi \in \Aut(H)$ and $x=\psi(y)\in \psi(Z(H))$ so $y\in Z(H)$, then for arbitrary $h\in H$,
 \[
 \psi(y)h 
 &= \psi(y) (\psi \circ \psi\inv)(h) \\
 &= \psi( y \cdot \psi\inv(h) ) \\
 &= \psi( \psi\inv(h) \cdot y ) && \text{since } \psi\inv(h)\in H, \, y\in Z(H) \\
 &= h\psi(y)
 .\]
- That $A \ch B \normal C \implies A\normal C$:
  - $A\ch B$ iff $A$ is fixed by every $\psi\in \Aut(B)$., WTS $cAc\inv = A$ for all $c\in C$.
  - Since $B\normal C$, the automorphism $\psi(\wait) \da c(\wait)c\inv$ descends to an element of $\Aut(B)$.
  - Then $\psi(A) = A$ since $A\ch B$, so $cAc\inv = A$ and $A\normal C$.

Show that subgroup of $G$ generated by $s$ and $t$ is a dihedral group.

- Suppose $G = \gens{ a, b}$ with $a^2 = b^2 = e$, satisfying some unknown relations.
- Consider $ab$. Since $G$ is finite, this has finite order, so $(ab)^n = e$ for some $n\geq 2$.
- Note $\gens{ab, b} \subseteq \gens{a, b}$, since any finite word in $ab, b$ is also a finite word in $a, b$.
- Since $(ab)b = ab^2 = a$, we have $\gens{ab, b} \subseteq \gens{a, b}$, so $\gens{ab, b} = \gens{a, b}$.
- Write $D_{2n} = F(r, s) / \ker \pi$ for $\pi: F(r, s)\to D_{2n}$ the canonical presentation map.
- Define 
\[
\psi: F(r, s) &\to G \\
r &\mapsto ab \\
t &\mapsto b
.\]
- This is clearly surjective since it hits all generators.
- We'll show that $ab, a$ satisfy all of the relations defining $D_{2n}$, which factors $\psi$ through $\ker \pi$, yielding a surjection $\tilde \psi: D_{2n} \surjects G$.
  - $(ab)^n = e$ by construction, $b^2 = e$ by assumption, and 
  \[
  b (ab) b\inv = babb\inv = ba = b\inv a\inv = (ab)\inv
  ,\]
  corresponding to the relation $srs\inv = r\inv$.
  Here we've used that $o(a) = o(b) = 2$ implies $a=a\inv, b=b\inv$.

- Surjectivity of $\tilde \psi$ yields $2n = \# D_{2n} \geq \# G$.
- The claim is that $\# G \geq 2n$, which forces $\# G = 2n$. 
  Then $\tilde \psi$ will be a surjective group morphism between groups of the same order, and thus an isomorphism.

  - We have \( \gens{ ab }\leq G  \), so $n\divides \# G$.
  - Since $b\not\in \gens{ ab }$, this forces $\# G > n$, so $\# G \geq 2n$.

- Write $\# G = p^2 q$
- Cases: first assume $p>q$, then do $q<p$.
- In any case, we have
\[
n_p \divides q &\implies n_p \in \ts{ 1,q } \\ \\
n_q \divides p^2 &\implies n_q \in \ts{ 1, p, p^2} 
.\]

- If $n_p=1$ or $n_q=1$, we're done, so suppose otherwise.

- **Case 1:** $:p>q$.
  - Using that $[n_p]_p \equiv 1$, consider reducing elements in $\ts{1, q} \mod p$.
  - Since $q<p$, we just have $q\mod p = q$, and as long as $q\neq 1$ we have $q\not\equiv 1\mod p$.
    But since $n_p\neq 1$ and $n_p\neq q$, this is a contradiction. $\contradiction$

- **Case 2:** $p< q$:
  - Using that $[n_q]_q \equiv 1$, consider reducing $\ts{1, p, p^2}\mod q$.
  - Since now $p<q$, we have $p\mod q = p$ itself, so $p\mod q \neq 1$ and we can rule it out.
  - The remaining possibility is $n_q = p^2$.
  - Supposing that $n_p \neq 1$, we have $n_p=q$, so we can count 
  \[
  \text{Elements from Sylow } q: n_q( \# S_q - 1) &= p^2(q-1) + 1
  ,\]
  where we've used that distinct Sylow $q$s can only intersect at the identity, and although Sylow $p$s *can* intersect trivially, they can also intersect in a subgroup of size $p$.
  - Suppose all Sylow $p$s intersect trivially, we get at least
  \[
  \text{Elements from Sylow } p: n_p( \# S_p - 1) &= q(p^2-1) 
  .\]
  Then we get a count of how many elements the Sylow $p$s and $q$s contribute:
  \[
  q(p^2-1) + p^2(q-1) + 1
  = p^2q - q + p^2q - p^2 + 1 
  = p^2q + (p^2-1)(q-1)
  > p^2q = \# G
  ,\]
  provided $(p^2-1)(q-1) \neq 0$, which is fine for $p\geq 2$ since this is at least $(2^2-1)(3-2) = 3$ (since $p<q$ and $q=3$ is the next smallest prime). $\contradiction$

  - Otherwise, we get two Sylow $p$s intersecting nontrivially, which must be in a subgroup of order at least $p$ since the intersection is a subgroup of both.
  In this case, just considering these two subgroups, we get
  \[
  \text{Elements from Sylow } p: n_p( \# S_p - 1) &> p^2 + p^2 - p = 2p^2-p -1
  .\]
  Then a count:
  \[
  p^2(q-1) + (2p^2-p - 1) + 1
  &= p^2 q- p^2 + 2p^2 -p \\
  &= p^2 q + p^2 -p \\
  &= p^2q + p(p-1) \\
  &> p^2q = \# G
  ,\]
  a contradiction since this inequality is strict provided $p\geq 2$. $\contradiction$

- If $\abs{\Fix(g)} > 0$ for all $g\neq e$, the remaining term is at least $\abs{G} -1$.
  But then the right-hand side yields is at least $2 + (\abs{G} -1) = \abs{G} + 1$, contradicting the equality.

- We want to show $Q, R\normal G$, so we proceed by showing $\textbf{not }\qty{n_5 = 21 \text{ or } n_7 = 15}$, which is equivalent to $\qty{n_5 = 1 \text{ and } n_7 = 1}$ by the previous restrictions.

- Note that we can write
\[
G = \theset{\text{elements of order } n} \disjoint \theset{\text{elements of order not } n}
.\]
  for any $n$, so we count for $n=5, 7$:

  - Elements in $QR$ of order **not** equal to 5: $\abs{QR - Q\theset{\id} + \theset{\id}} = 35 - 5 + 1 = 31$
  - Elements in $QR$ of order **not** equal to 7: $\abs{QR - \theset{\id}R + \theset{\id}} = 35 - 7 + 1 = 29$

- Since $QR \leq G$, we have

  - Elements in $G$ of order **not** equal to 5 $\geq 31$.
  - Elements in $G$ of order **not** equal to 7 $\geq 29$.

- Now both cases lead to contradictions:

  - $n_5 = 21$:
\[
\abs{G}  &= \abs{\theset{\text{elements of order } 5} \disjoint \theset{\text{elements of order not } 5}} \\
&\geq n_5(5-1) + 31 = 21(4) + 31 = 115 > 105 = \abs{G}

  - $n_7 = 15$:
\[
\abs{G}  &= \abs{\theset{\text{elements of order } 7} \disjoint \theset{\text{elements of order not } 7}} \\
&\geq n_7(7-1) + 29 = 15(6) + 29 = 119 > 105 = \abs{G}
.\]

:::

:::{.proof title="of 4"}
Suppose $P$ is normal and recall $\abs{P} = 3, \abs{Q} = 5, \abs{R} = 7$.

- $P\intersect QR = \theset{e}$ since $(3, 35) = 1$ 
- $R\intersect PQ = \theset{e}$ since $(5, 21) = 1$ 
- $Q\intersect RP = \theset{e}$ since $(7, 15) = 1$ 

We also have $PQR = G$ since $\abs{PQR} = \abs{G}$ (???).

We thus have an internal direct product 
\[
G \cong P\cross Q \cross R \cong \ZZ_3 \cross \ZZ_5 \cross \ZZ_7 \cong \ZZ_{105}

Strategy: get $p$ to divide $\abs{Z(G)}$.

- Apply the class equation:
\[
\abs{G} = \abs{Z(G)} + \sum [G: C_G(x_i)]
.\]

- Since $C_G(x_i) \leq G$ and $\abs{G} = p^k$, by Lagrange $\abs{C_G(x_i)} = p^\ell$ for some $0\leq \ell \leq k$.
- Since $\abs{G} = p^k$ for some $k$ and $Z(G), C_G(x_i) \leq G$ are subgroups, their orders are powers of $p$.
- Use $$[G: C_G(x_i)] = 1 \iff C_G(x_i) = G \iff \theset{g\in G\suchthat gx_ig\inv = x_i} = G \iff x_i \in Z(G).$$
  - Thus every index appearing in the sum is greater than 1, and thus equal to $p^{\ell_i}$ for some $1\leq \ell_i \leq k$
  - So $p$ divides every term in the sum

- Rearrange 
\[
\abs{G} -  \sum [G: C_G(x_i)]
= \abs{Z(G)}

- $p$ divides both terms on the LHS, so must divide the RHS, so $\abs{Z(G)} \geq p$.

- $R$ is Euclidean iff it admits a Euclidean algorithm: there is a degree function $f: R\to \ZZ_{\geq 0}$ such that for all $a,b\in R$, there exist $q, r\in R$ such that $a = bq + r$ where $f(r) <f(b)$ or $r=0$.

- $R$ is a UFD iff every $r\in R$ can be written as $r = u \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$ with $n\geq 0$, $u\in R\units$, and $p_i$ irreducible.
  This is unique up to associates of the $p_i$ and reordering.

- Euclidean implies UFD:
  - Euclidean implies PID:
    - If $I \in \Id(R)$ one can use the degree function to find any $b \in I$ where $f(b)$ is minimal.
    - Then $I = \gens{b}$, since if $a\in I$ one can write $a = bq + r$ and use that $a-bq \in I \implies r\in I$.
    - But by minimality, we can't have $f(r)<f(b)$, so $r=0$ and $a \divides b$, so $b\in \gens{a}$.
    
  - PID implies UFD:
    - Use that irreducible implies prime in a PID, so every $x\in R$ has some factorization into finitely many primes.
    - Supposing $x = u_p \prod_{i=1}^m p_i = u_q \prod_{i=1}^n q_i$, use that $p_1$ divides the LHS and so $p_1$ divides the RHS.
    WLOG, $p_1\divides q_1$, so $q_1 = u_1 p_1$ for $u\in R\units$, so $x = u_q u_1 p_1 \prod_{i=2}^m q_i$ by rewriting a term on the RHS.
    - Note that this makes $p_1, q_1$ associates.
    - Continuing up to $m$, we get
  \[
  x 
  &= u_p \prod_{i=1}^m p_i \\
  &= 
  u_q \prod_{i=1}^m u_i p_i \prod_{k=m+1}^n q_i \\
  \implies 
  u_p 
  &= u_q \prod_{i=1}^m u_i \prod_{k=m+1}^n q_i \\
  \tilde u 
  &= \prod_{k=m+1}^n q_i
  ,\]
    where we've moved all units to the LHS.
    This makes $p_i, q_i$ associates for $i\leq m$.
    - But primes aren't units and the product of nontrivial primes can't be a unit, so the right-hand side product must be empty.
    - So $m=n$ and all $p_i, q_i$ are associate, QED.

- UFD does not imply Euclidean:
  - It suffices to find a UFD that is not a PID.
  - Take $R \da \CC[x, y]$, which is a UFD by the usual factorization of polynomials.
  It is not a PID, since $\gens{2, x}$ is not principal.

For a ring $R$, let $U(R)$ denote the multiplicative group of units in $R$. Recall that in an integral domain $R$, $r \in R$ is called *irreducible* if $r$ is not a unit in R, and the only divisors of $r$ have the form $ru$ with $u$ a unit in $R$. 

We call a non-zero, non-unit $r \in R$ *prime* in $R$ if $r \divides ab \implies r \divides a$ or $r \divides b$.

- $R$ is an integral domain:
  - Let $\alpha = a + b\sqrt{-5}$ and $\beta = c + d \sqrt{-5}$ and set $\bar \alpha, \bar \beta$ be their conjugates.
  - Then
  \[
  0 = \alpha \beta = \alpha\bar\alpha \beta\bar\beta = (a^2-5b^2)(c^2-5d^2) \in \ZZ
  ,\]
  so one factor is zero.
  - If $a^2 = 5b^2$ then $a = \sqrt{5} b \not\in \ZZ$ unless $a=b=0$.
    Otherwise, the same argument forces $c=d=0$.

- The units are $\pm 1$:
  - Use that $u\in R\units \implies N(u) = \pm 1$, and $N(\alpha) = \alpha \bar\alpha = (a+b\sqrt{-5})(a-b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2 = 1$
    forces $b=0$ and $a=\pm 1$.

- Irreducible elements:
  - $2, 3$ are irreducible because if (say) $3=xy$ then $N(x)N(y) = N(3) = 9$, and if neither $x,y$ are units then $N(x) = N(y) = 3$.
    But $N(a + b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$ and $a^2 + 5b^2 = 3$ has no solutions.
    The same argument works for $2$.
  - $2\pm \sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible because $N(2 + \sqrt{-5}) = 2^2 + 5(1) = 9$, and in fact $N(2 - \sqrt{-5}) = 2^2 + 5(-1)^2 = 9$.
    By the same argument as above, this forces irreducibility.

- $3$ is not prime: 
  - We can write $6 = (3)(2) = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})$, so if we assume $3$ is prime we get $3\divides (1 \pm \sqrt{-5})$.
  - But writing $(1\pm \sqrt{-5}) = 3r$ for some $r\in R$ yields 
  \[
  (1 \pm \sqrt{-5}) = 3(a + b\sqrt{-5}) \implies 3a=1, 3b = \pm 1
  .\]
  These have no solutions $a, b\in \ZZ$. $\contradiction$

- The important assumption is $a(x)\not\in R[x]$, we'll assume $R$ is a UFD and try to contradict this.
- Write $f(x) = a(x)b(x)\in F[x]$, then if $R$ is a UFD we have $r,s\in F$ such that $f(x) = ra(x) sb(x) \in R[x]$.
- Since $a(x), b(x)$ are monic and $f=ab$, $f$ is monic, and by the factorization in $R[x]$ we have $rs=1$.
  So $r,s\in R\units$.

  - Explicitly, every monic linear $p\in R[x]$ is of the form $x + 2t\sqrt{2}$ with $t\in \ZZ$, and $\pm \sqrt{2} \neq 2t\sqrt{2}$ for any $t$.

## Ideals (Prime, Maximal, Proper, Principal, etc)

a.
Define *prime ideal*, give an example of a nontrivial ideal in the ring $\ZZ$ that is not prime, and prove that it is not prime.

b.
Define *maximal ideal*, give an example of a nontrivial maximal ideal in $\ZZ$ and prove that it is maximal.

- $\mfp$ is **prime** iff $xy\in \mfp \implies x\in \mfp$ or $y\in \mfp$.
  - An ideal $I\normal \ZZ$ that is not prime: $I \da 8\ZZ$.
  - For example, $2\cdot 4\in 8\ZZ$ but neither 2 nor 4 is a multiple of 8.

- $\mfm$ is **maximal** iff whenever $I\contains \mfm$ is an ideal in $R$, then either $I=\mfm$ or $I = R$.
  - A maximal ideal in $\ZZ$: $p\ZZ$.
  This is because primes are maximal in a PID and $p\ZZ$ is a prime ideal.
  Alternatively, "to contain is to divide" holds for Dedekind domains, so $m\ZZ \contains p\ZZ \iff m\divides p$, which forces $m=1,p$, so either $m\ZZ = p\ZZ$ or $m\ZZ = \ZZ$.

- The claim is that $I \da \gens{x, y}$ is not principal.
- Toward a contradiction, if so, then $\gens{x, y} = \gens{f}$.
- So write $x = fg$ for some $g\in \CC[x, y]$, then 
  - $\deg_x(x) = 1$, so $\deg_x(fg) = 1$ which forces $\deg_x(f) \leq 1$.
  - $\deg_y(y) = 1$, so $\deg_y(fg) = 1$ which forces $\deg_y(f) \leq 1$.
  - So $f(x, y) = ax + by + c$ for some $a,b,c\in \CC$.
  - $\deg_x(y) = 0$ and thus $\deg_x(fg) = 0$, forcing $a=0$
  - $\deg_y(x) = 0$ and thus $\deg_y(fg) = 0$, forcing $b=0$
  - So $f(x, y) = c \in \CC$.
- But $\CC[x]$ is a field, so $c$ is a unit in $\CC$ and thus $\CC[x, y]$, so $\gens{f} = \gens{c} = \CC[x, y]$.
- This is a contradiction, since $1\not\in \gens{x, y}$:
  - Every element in $\alpha(x, y) \in\gens{x, y}$ is of the form $\alpha(x, y) = xp(x, y) + yq(x, y)$.
  - But $\deg_x(\alpha) \geq 1, \deg_y(\alpha)\geq 1$, while $\deg_x(1) = \deg_y(1) = 0$.
  - So $\gens{x, y} \neq \CC[x, y]$.
- Alternatively, $\gens{x, y}$ is proper since $\CC[x, y] / \gens{x, y} \cong \CC \neq \CC[x, y]$.

Given a chain $J_1 \subseteq \cdots$, there is an upper bound $J \definedas \union J_i$, so Zorn's lemma applies.

$\implies$:

- We will show that $x\in J(R) \implies 1+x \in R\units$, from which the result follows by letting $x=rx$.

- Let $x\in J(R)$, so it is in every maximal ideal, and suppose toward a contradiction that $1+x$ is **not** a unit.

- Then consider $I = \generators{1+x} \normal R$. 
Since $1+x$ is not a unit, we can't write $s(1+x) = 1$ for any $s\in R$, and so $1 \not\in I$ and $I\neq R$

- So $I < R$ is proper and thus contained in some maximal proper ideal $\mathfrak{m} < R$ by part (1), and so we have $1+x \in \mathfrak{m}$.
Since $x\in J(R)$, $x\in \mathfrak{m}$ as well.

- But then $(1+x) - x = 1 \in \mathfrak{m}$ which forces $\mathfrak{m} = R$.

$\impliedby$

- Fix $x\in R$, and suppose $1+rx$ is a unit for all $r\in R$.

 
- Suppose towards a contradiction that there is a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ such that $x\not \in \mathfrak{m}$ and thus $x\not\in J(R)$.

- Consider 
\[
M' \definedas \theset{rx + m \suchthat r\in R,~ m\in M}
.\]

- Since $\mathfrak{m}$ was maximal, $\mathfrak{m} \subsetneq M'$ and so $M' = R$.

- So every element in $R$ can be written as $rx + m$ for some $r\in R, m\in M$.
But $1\in R$, so we have 
\[
1 = rx + m
.\] 

- So let $s = -r$ and write $1 = sx - m$, and so $m = 1 + sx$.

- Since $s\in R$ by assumption $1+sx$ is a unit and thus $m \in \mathfrak{m}$ is a unit, a contradiction.

- So $x\in \mathfrak{m}$ for every $\mathfrak{m}$ and thus $x\in J(R)$.

:::

:::{.proof title="of c: $J(R) = \mathfrak N(R)$"}
$\mathfrak N(R) \subseteq J(R)$:

- Use the fact $x\in \mathfrak N(R) \implies x^n = 0 \implies 1 + rx$ is a unit $\iff x\in J(R)$ by (b):
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-x)^k = \frac{1 - (-x)^n}{1- (-x)} = (1+x)\inv
.$$

$J(R) \subseteq \mathfrak N(R)$:

- Let $x \in J(R) \setminus \mathfrak N(R)$.

- Since $R$ is finite, $x^m = x$ for some $m > 0$.

- Without loss of generality, we can suppose $x^2 = x$ by replacing $x^m$ with $x^{2m}$.

- If $1-x$ is not a unit, then $\generators{1-x}$ is a nontrivial proper ideal, which by (a) is contained in some maximal ideal $\mm$. 
But then $x\in \mm$ and $1-x \in \mm \implies x + (1-x) = 1 \in \mm$, a contradiction.

- So $1-x$ is a unit, so let $u = (1-x)\inv$.

- Then
\[
(1-x)x &= x - x^2 = x - x = 0 \\
&\implies u (1-x)x = x = 0 \\

- Suppose $c\da f(a)\neq 0$, noting that $c$ may not be positive.
- By continuity, pick $\eps$ small enough so that $\abs{x-a}<\eps \implies \abs{f(x) - f(a)} < c/2$.
  Since we're on the interval, we have $f(x) \in (f(a) - c/2, f(a) + c/2) = (c/2, 3c/2)$ which is a ball of radius $c/2$ about $c$, which thus doesn't intersect $0$.
- So $f(x) \neq 0$ on this ball, and $g \da f^2 > 0$ on it.
  Note that ideals are closed under products, so $g\in I$
- Moreover $f^2(x) \geq 0$ since squares are non-negative, so $g\geq 0$ on $[0, 1]$.
:::

:::{.proof title="of b"}
\envlist

- By contrapositive, suppose $V(I)= \emptyset$, we'll show $I$ contains a unit and thus $I=R$.
- For each fixed $x\in [0, 1]$, since $V(I)$ is empty there is some $f_x$ such that $f_x(x) \neq 0$.
- By (a), there is some $g_x$ with $g_x(x) > 0$ on a neighborhood $U_x\ni x$ and $g_x \geq 0$ everywhere.
- Ranging over all $x$ yields a collection $\ts{(g_x, U_x) \st x\in [0, 1]}$ where $\ts{U_x}\covers [0, 1]$.
- By compactness there is a finite subcover, yielding a finite collection $\ts{(g_k, U_k)}_{k=1}^n$ for some $n$.
- Define the candidate unit as 
\[
G(x) \da {1\over \sum_{k=1}^n g_k(x)}
.\]
- This is well-defined: fix an $x$, then the denominator is zero at $x$ iff $g_k(x) = 0$ for all $k$.
  But since the $U_k$ form an open cover, $x\in U_\ell$ for some $\ell$, and $g_\ell > 0$ on $U_\ell$.
- Since ideals are closed under sums, $H\da {1\over G} \da \sum g_k \in I$.
  But $H$ is clearly a unit since $HG = \id$.

:::{.proof title="of c"}

- If $I\normal R$ is maximal, $I\neq R$, and so by (b) we have $V(I) \neq \emptyset$.
- So there is some $x_0\in[0, 1]$ with $f(x_0) = 0$ for all $f\in I$.
- Define $\mfm_{x_0} \da \ts{f\in R \st f(x_0) = 0}$, which is clearly an ideal.
  - This is a proper ideal, since constant nonzero functions are continuous and thus in $R$, not not $\mfm_{x_0}$.
- We thus have $I \subseteq \mfm_{x_0}$, and by maximality they are equal.

## Zero Divisors and Nilpotents

### Spring 2014 #5 $\done$
Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $a\in R$.
Prove that $a$ is not nilpotent $\iff$ there exists a commutative ring $S$ and a ring homomorphism $\phi: R\to S$ such that $\phi(a)$ is a unit.

> Note: by definition, $a$ is nilpotent $\iff$ there is a natural number $n$ such that $a^n = 0$.


:::{.solution}
$\not A\implies \not B$:

- Suppose $a$ is nilpotent, so $a^m = 0_R$, and suppose $\phi: R\to S$ is a ring morphism.
- Ring morphisms send zero to zero, so $0_S = \phi(0_R) = \phi(a^m) = \phi(a)^m$ and $\phi(a)$ is nilpotent.
- But nontrivial rings can't contain nilpotent units: if $u$ is a unit and $ut= 1$ with $u^k=0$, then $1 = 1^k = (ut)^k = u^k t^k=0$ and $R=0$.


$A\implies B$:

- If $a$ is not nilpotent, localize at the infinite multiplicative subset $A \da \ts{1, a, a^2, \cdots}$ to obtain $R\localize{A}$.
  Since $0\not\in A$, this is not the zero ring.
- By the universal property, there is a map $\phi: R\to R\localize{A}$, and the claim is that $\phi(a)$ is a unit in $R\localize{A}$.
- More directly, $\phi(a) = [a/1] \in \ts{p,q \st p\in R, q\in A}$, which has inverse $[a/1]$.

- Write $f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k$, and supposing it's a zero divisor choose $g(x) = \sum_{k=0}^m b_k x^k$ of minimal degree so that $g\neq 0, b_m\neq 0$, and $f(x)g(x) = 0$.
- The claim is that the top coefficient $b_m$ will suffice.
- Write the product:
\[
0 = f(x)g(x) 
= (a_0 + \cdots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_n x^n)
(b_0 + \cdots + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + b_m x^m)
.\]
- Equating coefficients, the coefficient for $x^{m+n}$ must be zero, so (**importantly**) $a_n b_m = 0$.
  - Since $a_n b_m=0$, consider $a_ng(x)$.
    This has degree $d_1 \leq m-1$ but satisfies $a_ng(x)f(x) = a_n(g(x)f(x)) = 0$, so by minimality $a_ng(x) = 0$.
  - This forces $a_n b_0 = \cdots = a_n b_{m-1} = 0$, so $a_n$ annihilates all of the $b_k$.
- Now consider the coefficient of $x^{m+n-1}$, given by $a_{n-1}b_m + a_{n}b_{m-1}$.
  - The second term $a_n b_{m-1}=0$ since $a_n$ annihilates all $b_k$, so (**importantly**) $a_{n-1} b_m = 0$.
  - Considering now $a_{n-1}g(x)$:
    - The same argument shows this has degree $d_2 \leq m-1$ but $a_{n-1}g(x)f(x) = 0$, so $a_{n-1}g(x) = 0$.
    - So $a_{n-1}$ annihilates all $b_k$, and allowing this process to continue inductively.
- For good measure, the coefficient of $x^{m+n-2}$ is $a_{n-2}b_m + a_{n-1}b_{m-1} + a_{n}b_{m-2}$.
  - Note that $a_n, a_{n-1}$ annihilate all $b_k$, so (**importantly**) $a_{n-2} b_m=0$, and so on.

- Thus $a_k b_m = 0$ for all $0\leq k \leq n$, and by linearity and commutativity, we have
\[
b_m f(x) = b_m \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k = \sum_{k=0}^n (b_m a_k) x^k = 0

- Let $y\in \im \phi_r \da \theset{y \da rx \suchthat x\in R}$, we want to show $\ker \phi_y$ is nontrivial by producing some $z$ such that $yz=0$.

Since every element in a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor, and $\abs{R\units} \geq 2$ since $\pm 1$ are always units, we must have $\abs{R} = 4$.

- Since the characteristic of a ring must divide its size, we have $\ch R = 2$ or $4$.

- Using the hint, we see that only $\ZZ/(4)$ has characteristic 4, which has exactly 2 zero divisors given by $[0]_4$ and $[2]_4$.

- If $R$ has characteristic 2, we can check the other 3 possibilities.

- We can write $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2) = \theset{a + bt \suchthat a,b\in \ZZ/(2)}$, and checking the multiplication table we have
\[
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
			& 0 & 1 	& t & 1+t 	\\ \hline
0 		& 0 & 0 	& 0 & 0   	\\ 
1 		& 0 & 1 	& t & 1+t 	\\ 
t 		& 0 & t 	& \mathbf{0} & t   	\\ 
1 + t & 0 & 1+t & t & 1   	\\ 
\end{array}
,\]

  and so we find that $t, 0$ are the zero divisors.

- In $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2 - t)$, we can check that $t^2 = t \implies t t^2 = t^2 \implies t(t^2 + 1) = 0 \implies t(t+1) = 0$, so both $t$ and $t+1$ are zero divisors, along with zero, so this is not a possibility.

- Similarly, in $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2 + t + 1)$, we can check the bottom-right corner of the multiplication table to find
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c|cc}
	& t 	& 1 +t \\ \hline
t & 1+t & 1 \\
t & 1 	& t \\
\end{array}\right]
,\]

  and so this ring only has one zero divisor.

- Thus the only possibilities are:
\[
R &\cong \ZZ/(4) \\
R &\cong \ZZ/(2)[t] / (t^2)

  There is at least on ideal of $R$ disjoint from $S$, namely $(0)$.

  By Zorn's lemma the set of ideals disjoint from $S$ has a maximal element with respect to inclusion, say $I$.
  In other words, $I$ is disjoint from $S$ and if $J$ is any ideal disjoint from $S$ with $I\subseteq J \subseteq R$ then $J=I$ or $J=R$.

  which is right-multiplication by $u$.
  By assumption, $\phi_u$ is surjective, so the principal ideal $Ru$ equals $R$.

- Then $K \da \ker \phi_u \in \Id(R)$ is an ideal.
- $K$ is proper -- otherwise, noting $Ru=R$, if $K=R$ we have $Ru = 0$ and thus $R=0$.
  So suppose $R\neq 0$.
- Take a poset $S \da \ts{J\in \Id(R) \st J \contains K, J\neq R}$, the set of all ideals containing $K$, ordered by subset inclusion.
  Note that $K \in S$, so $S$ is nonempty.
- Apply Zorn's lemma: let $C: C_1 \subseteq C_2 \subseteq \cdots$ be a chain (totally ordered sub-poset) in $S$.
  If $C$ is the empty chain, $K$ is an upper bound.
  Otherwise, if $C$ is nonempty, define $\hat{C} \da \Union_{i=1}^\infty C_i$.

- Let $ab\in \mfp$, we want to show $a\in \mfp$ or $b\in\mfp$.

  By maximality, $\mfp + Ra = R$, and so $\mfp + Ra$ intersects $S$.
  Similarly $\mfp + Rb = R$ so $\mfp + Rb$ intersects $S$.
- Produce elements $x\da p_1 + r_1a, y\da p_2 + r_2b\in S$, then since $S$ is multiplicatively closed,

xy&\da (p_1 + r_1 a)(p_2 + r_2b)\in S \\

:::{.solution}

- A ring is **Noetherian** iff $R$ satisfies the ascending chain condition: every chain of ideals $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq \cdots$ eventually stabilizes, so $A_m \subseteq A_{m+1} = A_{m+2} = \cdots$.

- That $R$ is a subring of $\ZZ[x]$:
  - $(R, +)$ is an abelian subgroup: note that $f(x) + g(x) = \sum a_k x^k + \sum b_k x^k = \sum (a_k + b_k) x^k$, so if $a_k, b_k$ are even then $a_k + b_k$ is even.
    It's closed under inverses, since $a_k$ is even iff $-a_k$ is even, and contains zero.
  - $(R, \cdot)$ is a submonoid: $f(x) g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^N \qty{ \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_{n-k}} x^k$ where without loss of generality, $\deg f = \deg g = n$ by setting coefficients to zero.
    Then sums and products of even integers are even, so $fg \in R$.

- That $R$ is not Noetherian: it suffices to show that $R$ contains an ideal that is not finitely generated.
- The claim is that setting $S \da \ts{2x^k}_{k\in \ZZ_{\geq 1}}$ and taking 
\[
I \da \gens{S} = \sum_{k\in \ZZ_{\geq 1}} R\cdot 2x^k \da \ts{ \sum_{i=1}^m r_k(x) 2x^k \st r_k(x) \in 2\ZZ[x], m\in \ZZ_{\geq 0}}

  Since $I$ is an ideal, we have $\eps_{ii}\in I$ for every $i$.

  Provided $y\neq 0$, we have $2y\neq 0$, and so if $R\neq 0$ then there exists some nonzero $a\in R$, in which case $2a\neq 0$ and $2a\in 2R$.
  - That $2R$ is a right ideal: clear, since $(2y)\cdot r = 2(yr)\in 2R$.

  \[
  r\cdot 2y \da r(y+y) = ry + ry \da 2(ry) \in 2R

  - Use the contrapositive of condition (1), so that $2x = 0 \implies x=0$.
  - Suppose toward a contradiction that $x=2y_1 = 2y_2$, then

- Reduce to a group theory problem: $[E:F] = [G:H]$, despite the fact that $E/F$ is not necessarily Galois.
  This is because we can count in towers:
  \[
  [K:F] = [K:E][E:F] &\implies [G:1] = [K:E][H:1] \\
  &\implies \# G = [K:E] \# H \\
  &\implies [G:H] = {\# G \over \# H} = [K:E]
  .\]

- Essential fact: if $P \in \Syl_p(G)$, we can use that $P \subseteq N_G(P) \subset H$ and so $P\in \Syl_p(H)$ as well.
- Now use that $N_G(P) \subseteq H$, and do Sylow theory for $P$ in both $G$ and $H$:
  - Sylow 3 on $G$ yields $n_p(G) = [G: N_G(P)] \equiv 1 \mod p$.
  - Sylow 3 on $H$ yields $n_p(H) = [G: N_H(P)] \equiv 1 \mod p$.
- Claim: $N_H(P) = N_G(P)$.
  - We have $N_H(P) \subseteq N_G(P)$ since $H \subseteq G$, so $hPh\inv = P$ remains true regarding either $h\in H$ or $h\in G$.
  - For $N_G(P) \subseteq N_H(P)$, use that $N_G(P) \subseteq H$ and so $gPg\inv = P$ implies $g\in H$, so $g\in N_H(P)$.

- Now morally one might want to apply an isomorphism theorem:
\[
{G/ N_G(P) \over H/N_H(P)}=
{G/ N_H(P) \over H/N_H(P)}\cong
{G\over H}
,\]
  but we don't have normality.
  However, we can still get away with the corresponding counting argument if everything is finite:
  \[
  {[G: N_G(P)] \over [H:N_H(P)] }=
  {[G: N_H(P)] \over [H:N_H(P)] }=
  {\# G / \# N_H(P) \over \# H / \#N_H(P)}
  = {\# G \over \# H} 
  = [G: H]
  .\]

- We have an equation of the form $n_p(G)/n_p(H) = m$, and we want to show $m\equiv 1 \mod p$.
  So write
  \[
  {n_p(G) \over n_p(H) } 
  = m \implies m n_p(H) &= n_p(G) \\
  \implies m n_p(H) &\equiv n_p(G) \mod p \\
  \implies m\cdot 1 &\equiv 1 \mod p \\
  \implies m &\equiv 1 \mod p
  .\]

### Fall 2019 Midterm #9  $\done$
Let $n\geq 3$ and $\zeta_n$ be a primitive $n$th root of unity. Show that $[\QQ(\zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv): \QQ] = \phi(n)/2$ for $\phi$ the totient function.

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- Some notation: let $\alpha_k \da \zeta_n^k + \zeta_n^{-k}$.
- Let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha_1 \da \zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv$.
  Note that $\alpha_1 \in \QQ(\zeta_n)$. 
- Use that $\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_n)/\QQ) \cong C_n\units$, consisting of maps $\sigma_k: \zeta \mapsto \zeta^k$ for $\gcd(k, n) = 1$, of which there are $\phi(n)$ many.
- Galois transitively permutes the roots of irreducible polynomials, so the roots of $m$ are precisely the Galois conjugates of $\alpha$, i.e. the Galois orbit of $\alpha$, so we can just compute it.
  For illustrative purposes, suppose $n$ is prime, then
  \[
  \sigma_1(\zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv) &= \zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv =\alpha_1 \\
  \sigma_2(\zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv) &= \zeta_n^2 + \zeta_n^{-2} = \alpha_2 \\
  \sigma_3(\zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv) &= \zeta_n^3 + \zeta_n^{-3} = \alpha_3 \\
  \vdots&\\
  \sigma_{n-1}(\zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv) &= \zeta_n^{n-1} + \zeta_n^{-(n-1)} = \zeta_n^{-1} + \zeta_n^{1} = \alpha_1 \\
  \sigma_{n-2}(\zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv) &= \zeta_n^{n-2} + \zeta_n^{-(n-2)} = \zeta_n^{-2} + \zeta_n^{2} = \alpha_2 \\
  \sigma_{n-3}(\zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv) &= \zeta_n^{n-3} + \zeta_n^{-(n-3)} = \zeta_n^{-3} + \zeta_n^{3} = \alpha_3
  ,\]
  where we've used that $\zeta^{k} = \zeta^{k\mod n}$.
  From this, we see that $\sigma_{k}(\alpha_1)=\sigma_{n-k}(\alpha_1)$ and we pick up $(n-1)/2$ distinct conjugates.

- For $n$ not prime, the exact same argument runs through $\phi(n)$ values of $k$ for $\sigma_k$, and again yields $\sigma_{k}(\alpha_1) = \sigma_{\phi(n) - k}(\alpha_1)$.
  Matching them up appropriately yields $\phi(n)/2$ distinct roots.

Part 1:

- $L/K$ is cyclic means $L/K$ is Galois and $G\da \Gal(L/K) = C_n$ for some $n$.
- By the FTGT, setting $H \da \Gal(L/E)$, we get $H \normal G$ precisely because $E/K$ is normal, and $\Gal(L/E) = G/H$.
- But then if $G$ is cyclic, $H \leq G$ must be cyclic, and $G/H$ is cyclic as well since writing $G = C_n = \gens{x}$, we have $G/H = \gens{xH}$.

Part 2:

- Letting $G\da\Gal(L/K) = C_n$, by elementary group theory we have subgroups $H\da C_d \leq C_n$ for every $d$ dividing $n$.
  - A observation we'll need: every subgroup is normal here since $G$ is abelian.
- By the fundamental theorem, taking the fixed field of $H \leq \Gal(L/K)$, we obtain some intermediate extension $E\da K^H$ fitting into a tower $L/E/K$.
- By the fundamental theorem, $[E: K] = [G:H] = n/d$, where we've used that $H\normal G$.
- Letting $d$ range through divisors lets $n/d$ range through divisors, so we get extensions of every degree $d$ dividing $n$.

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- $L/k$ is **separable** iff every element $\alpha$ is separable, i.e. the minimal polynomial $m(x)$ of $\alpha$ is a separable polynomial, i.e. $m(x)$ has no repeated roots in (say) the algebraic closure of $L$ (or just any splitting field of $m$).

- If $\ch k = p$, suppose toward a contradiction that $L/k$ is not separable.
  Then there is some $\alpha$ with an inseparable (and irreducible) minimal polynomial $f(x)\in k[x]$.
- Claim: since $f$ is inseparable and irreducible, $f(x) = g(x^p)$ for some $g\in k[x]$.
  - Note: write $g(x) \da \sum a_k x^k$, so that $f(x) = \sum a_k (x^p)^k = \sum a_k x^{pk}$.
- This is a contradiction, since it makes $f$ reducible by using the "Freshman's dream":
\[
f(x) = \sum a_k x^{pk} = \qty{ \sum a_k^{1\over p} x^k}^p \da (h(x))^p 
.\]

- Proof of claim: in $\ch k = p, f$ inseparable $\implies f(x) = g(x^p)$. 
  - Use that $f$ is inseparable iff $\gcd(f, f') \neq 1$, and since $f$ is irreducible this forces $f' \equiv 0$, so $ka_k = 0$ for all $k$.
  - Then $a_k\neq 0$ forces $p\divides k$, so $f(x) = a_0 + a_px^p + a_{2p}x^{2p} + \cdots$ and one takes $g(x) \da \sum a_{kp}x^{kp}$.

- A finite inseparable extension:
  - It's a theorem that finite extensions of perfect fields are separable, so one needs a non-perfect field.
  - Take $L/k \da \FF_p(t^{1\over p}) / \FF_p(t)$, which is a degree $p$ extension (although both fields are infinite are characteristic $p$).
  - Then the minimal polynomial of $t$ is $f(x) \da x^p - t \in \FF_p(t)[x]$, where $f'(x) = px^p \equiv 0$
    Alternatively, just note that $f$ factors as $f(x) = (x-t^{1\over p})^p$ in $L[x]$, which has multiple roots.

### Fall 2020 #3 $\work$

a. Define what it means for a finite extension of fields $E$ over $F$ to be a *Galois* extension.

b. Determine the Galois group of $f(x) = x^3 - 7$ over $\QQ$, and justify your answer carefully.

c. Find all subfields of the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\QQ$.


:::{.solution}
Part a:

- A finite extension $E/F$ is **Galois** if it is normal and separable:
  - Normal: every $f\in F[x]$ either has no roots in $E$ or all roots in $E$.
  - Separable: every element $e\in E$ has a separable minimal polynomial $m(x)$, i.e. $m$ has no repeated roots.

Part b:

- Note $f$ is irreducible by Eisenstein with $p=7$, and since $\QQ$ is perfect, irreducible implies separable.
- Writing $L \da \SF(f)/\QQ$, this is a Galois extension:
  - $L$ is separable: it is a finite extension of a perfect field, which is automatically separable.
  - $L$ is normal: $L$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, and thus normal.
- Since $f$ is degree 3, we have $G\da \Gal(L/k) \leq S_3$, and since $G$ is a transitive subgroup the only possibilities are
\[
G = S_3 \cong D_3, A_3 \cong C_3
.\]

- Factor $x^3 - 7 = (x-\omega)(x-\zeta_3\omega)(x-\zeta_3^2\omega)$ where $\omega \da 7^{1\over 3}$ and $\zeta_3$ is a primitive 3rd root of unity.
  Then $L = \QQ(\zeta_3, \omega)$.
  - Aside: label the roots in this order, so $r_1 = \omega, r_2 = \zeta_3\omega, r_3 = \zeta_3^2\omega$.

- Write $\min_{\omega, \QQ}(x) = x^3 - 7$ and let $L_0/\QQ \da \QQ(\omega)/\QQ$ yields $[L_0: \QQ] = 3$.
- Write $\min_{\zeta_3, \QQ}(x) = (x^3-1)/(x-1) = x^2 + x + 1$, and note that this is still the minimal polynomial over $L_0$ since $L_0 \subseteq \RR$ and $\zeta_3 \in \CC\sm\RR$.
  So $[L:L_0] = 2$.

- Counting in towers,
\[
[L:\QQ] = [L:L_0][L_0: \QQ] = (2)(3) = 6
.\]
- But $\# S_3 = 6$ and $\# A_3 = 3$, so $G = S_3$.

- Explicitly, since we can write $\SF(f) = \QQ(\omega, \zeta_3)$, we can find explicit generators:
\[
\sigma:
&\begin{cases}
\omega &\mapsto \omega
\\
\zeta_3 &\mapsto \zeta_3\cdot \zeta_3.
\end{cases}
&&
\implies \sigma \sim (1,2,3) \\
\tau:
&\begin{cases}
\omega &\mapsto \omega
\\
\zeta_3 &\mapsto \bar{\zeta_3}.
\end{cases}
&&
\implies \tau \sim (2, 3)
.\]
  So $G = \gens{\sigma, \tau \st \sigma^3, \tau^2}$.

Part c:

- Note that the subgroup lattice for $S_3$ looks like the following:


![](figures/2021-08-14_18-00-51.png)

- Note that we can identify
  - $\tau = (2,3)$ which fixes $r_1$
  - $\sigma \tau = (1,2)$ which fixes $r_3$
  - $\sigma^2\tau = (1, 3)$ which fixes $r_2$
  - $\sigma = (1,2,3)$, for which we need to calculate the fixed field.
  Using that $\sigma(\omega) =\zeta\omega$ and $\sigma(\zeta)=\zeta$,
  supposing $\sigma(\alpha) = \alpha$ we have
  \[
  \sigma(\alpha) &\da \sigma(a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 + d\omega + e\zeta_3\omega + f\zeta_3^2\omega) \\
  &= a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 + d\zeta_3\omega + e\zeta_3^2\omega + f\omega \\
  \implies \alpha &= a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 + t_1(\omega + \zeta_3\omega + \zeta_3^2\omega) \\
  \implies \alpha &= a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 + t_1\omega (1 + \zeta_3+ \zeta_3^2) \\
  \implies \alpha &= a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 
  ,\]
  using the general fact that $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\zeta_n^k = 0$.
  So the fixed field is $\QQ(1, \zeta, \zeta^2) = \QQ(\zeta)$.

- We thus get the following lattice correspondence:

\begin{tikzcd}
	&& {\QQ(\zeta_3,\omega)} \\
	\\
	{\QQ(\omega) = \QQ(r_1)} & {\QQ(\zeta_3\omega) = \QQ(r_2)} & {\QQ(\zeta_3^2\omega) = \QQ(r_3)} && {\QQ(\zeta_3)} \\

### Spring 2021 #4 $\work$

Define
\[
f(x) \da x^4 + 4x^2 + 64 \in \QQ[x]
.\]

a. Find the splitting field $K$ of $f$ over $\QQ$.

b. Find the Galois group $G$ of $f$.

c. Exhibit explicitly the correspondence between subgroups of $G$ and intermediate fields between $\QQ$ and $K$.


:::{.concept}
\envlist

- Useful trick: given $a + \sqrt{b}$, try to rewrite this as $(\sqrt{c} + \sqrt{d})^2$ for some $c, d$ to get a better basis for $\SF(f)$.
:::


:::{.solution}
\envlist

- First consider $g(z) \da z^2 + 4z + 64$.
  Applying the quadratic formula yields
  \[
  z = {-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 64} \over 2} = -2 \pm {1\over 2}\sqrt{ -15 \cdot 16 } = -2 \pm 2i \sqrt{15}
  .\]
- Substituting $z=x^2$ yields the splitting field of $f$ as $L\da \QQ(\pm \sqrt{ -2 \pm 2i\sqrt{15}})$.

  - Note that this factorization shows that $f$ is irreducible over $\QQ$, since the two quadratic factors have irrational coefficients and none of the roots are real.
  - Irreducible implies separable over a perfect field, so $L/\QQ$ is a separable extension.
  - $L$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial and thus normal, making $L$ Galois.

- In this form, it's not clear what the degree $[L:\QQ]$ is, so we can find a better basis by rewriting the roots of $g$:
\[
z = -2 \pm 2i\sqrt{15} = \qty{\sqrt{5}}^2 - \qty{\sqrt 3}^2 \pm 2i\sqrt{5}\sqrt{3} = (\sqrt 5 \pm i\sqrt{3})^2
,\]
and so the roots of $f$ are $x = \pm \sqrt{5} \pm i\sqrt{3}$ and $L = \QQ(\sqrt 5, i\sqrt 3)$.

- Counting in towers, 
\[
[L:\QQ] = [\QQ(\sqrt 5, i \sqrt{3} ) : \QQ \sqrt{5} ][\QQ \sqrt{5} : \QQ] = (2)(2) = 4
,\]
where we've used that $\min_{\sqrt 5, \QQ}(x) = x^2-5$ and $\min_{i\sqrt 3, \QQ}(x) = x^2 + 3$, which remains the minimal polynomial over $\QQ(\sqrt 5) \subseteq \RR$ since both roots are not real.

- So $G\da \Gal(L/\QQ) \leq S_4$ is a transitive subgroup of size 4, making it either $C_4$ or $C_2^2$.

- Label the roots:
\[
r_1 &= \sqrt 5 + i\sqrt 3 \\
r_2 &= \sqrt{5} - i \sqrt{3} \\
r_3 &= - \sqrt 5 + i\sqrt 3 = -r_2 \\
r_4 &= -\sqrt{5} - i\sqrt{3} = -r_1
.\]


- We can start writing down automorphisms: 
\[
\sigma_1:
\begin{cases}
\sqrt 5 &\mapsto -\sqrt 5  
\\
i\sqrt 3 &\mapsto i\sqrt 3 .
\end{cases}
&& \sigma_1 \sim (1,3)(2,4)
\\
\sigma_2
\begin{cases}
\sqrt 5 &\mapsto \sqrt 5  
\\
i\sqrt 3 &\mapsto -i\sqrt 3 .
\end{cases}
&& \sigma_2 \sim (1, 2)(3, 4)
.\]
  Note that these define automorphisms because we've specified what happens to a basis and they send roots to other roots.

- Checking that $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \id$, this produces two distinct order 2 elements, forcing $G \cong C_2^2$ since $C_4$ only has one order 2 element.
  Explicitly, we have
\[
C_2^2 \cong G = \gens{\tau_1, \tau_2} = \ts{\id, \tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_1 \tau_2} = \ts{\id, (1,3)(2,4), (1,2)(3,4),  (1,4)(2,3) }
,\]
  and the generic subgroup lattice looks like:

![](figures/2021-08-15_00-02-28.png)

- Computing some fixed fields.
  Write $i \sqrt{3} = x, \sqrt{5} = y$, then elements in the splitting field are of the form
  $\alpha = 1 + ax + by + cxy$.

  - For $\sigma_1$, we have $x\mapsto -x$, so
  \[
  \sigma_1(\alpha) = 1 - ax + by - cxy
  = \alpha \implies a=-a=0, c=-c=0
  ,\]
  so this preserves $1+by$, making the fixed field $\QQ(1, y) = \QQ(i \sqrt{3})$.

  - For $\sigma_2$, we have $y\mapsto -y$, so
  \[
  \sigma_2(\alpha) = 1 +ax -by -cxy = \alpha \implies b=-b=0,c=-c=0
  ,\]
  preserving $1 + ax$ and making the fixed field $\QQ(1, x) = \QQ(\sqrt 5)$.

  - For $\sigma_1 \sigma_2$, we have $x\mapsto -x$ and $y\mapsto -y$, so
  \[
  \sigma_1\sigma_2(\alpha) = 1 -ax -by +cxy = \alpha \implies a=-a=-, b=-b=0
  ,\]
  preserving $1 + cxy$ and yielding $\QQ(xy) = \QQ(i\sqrt 3 \sqrt 5)$.

:::{.solution}
\envlist

:::{.proof title="of a"}
Note that $g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 2$ has roots $\beta = 2 \pm \sqrt{2}$, and so $f$ has roots 
\[
\alpha_1 &= \sqrt{2 + \sqrt 2} \\
\alpha_2 &= \sqrt{2 - \sqrt 2} \\
\alpha_3 &= -\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_4 &= -\alpha_2
.\]

and splitting field $K = \QQ(\theset{\alpha_i})$.

:::

:::{.proof title="of b"}
$K$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial and thus Galois over $\QQ$.
Moreover, Since $f$ is irreducible by Eisenstein with $p=2$, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S^4$, so the possibilities are:

- $S_4$
- $A_4$
- $D_4$
- $\ZZ/(2) \cross \ZZ/(2)$
- $\ZZ/(4)$

We can note that $g$ splits over $L \definedas \QQ(\sqrt 2)$, an extension of degree 2.

We can now note that $\min(\alpha, L)$ is given by $p(x) = x^2 - (2 + \sqrt 2)$, and so $[K: L] = 2$.

We then have
\[
[K: \QQ] = [K: L] [L : \QQ] = (2)(2) = 4
.\]

This $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = 4$, which leaves only two possibilities:

- $\ZZ/(2) \cross \ZZ/(2)$
- $\ZZ/(4)$

We can next check orders of elements.
Take
\[
\sigma &\in \Gal(K/\QQ) \\
\alpha_1 &\mapsto \alpha_2
.\]


Computations show that 

- $\alpha_1^2 \alpha_2^2 = 2$, so $\alpha_1 \alpha_2 = \sqrt 2$
- $\alpha_1^2 = 2 + \sqrt 2 \implies \sqrt 2 = \alpha_1^2 - 2$

and thus
\[
\sigma^2(\alpha_1) 
&= \sigma(\alpha_2) \\
&= \sigma\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\alpha_1}\right) \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\sqrt 2)}{\sigma(\alpha_1)} \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\alpha_1^2 - 2)}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \frac{\alpha_2^2 - 2}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -2\alpha_2\inv \\
&= \alpha_2 - \frac{2\alpha_1}{\sqrt 2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -\alpha_1 \sqrt 2 \\
&\neq \alpha_1
,\]

and so the order of $\sigma$ is strictly greater than 2, and thus 4, and thus $\Gal(K/\QQ) = \theset{\sigma^k \suchthat 1\leq k \leq 4} \cong \ZZ/(4)$.

Let $K = \QQ(\zeta)$. 
Then $K$ is the splitting field of $f(x) = x^n - 1$, which is irreducible over $\QQ$, so $K/\QQ$ is normal.
We also have $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ and $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ since they can not share any roots.

> Or equivalently, $f$ splits into distinct linear factors $f(x) = \prod_{k\leq n}(x-\zeta^k)$.

Since it is a Galois extension, $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = [K: \QQ] = \phi(n)$ for the totient function.

We can now define maps
\[
\tau_j: K &\to K \\
\zeta &\mapsto \zeta^j 
\]
and if we restrict to $j$ such that $\gcd(n, j) = 1$, this yields $\phi(n)$ maps.
Noting that if $\zeta$ is a primitive root, then $(n, j) = 1$ implies that that $\zeta^j$ is also a primitive root, and hence another root of $\min(\zeta, \QQ)$, and so these are in fact automorphisms of $K$ that fix $\QQ$ and thus elements of $\Gal(K/\QQ)$.

So define a map
\[
\theta: \ZZ_n\units &\to K \\
[j]_n &\mapsto \tau_j
.\]

from the *multiplicative* group of units to the Galois group.

The claim is that this is a surjective homomorphism, and since both groups are the same size, an isomorphism.

:::{.proof title="of surjectivity"}
Letting $\sigma \in K$ be arbitrary, noting that $[K: \QQ]$ has a basis $\theset{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}}$, it suffices to specify $\sigma(\zeta)$ to fully determine the automorphism.
(Since $\sigma(\zeta^k) = \sigma(\zeta)^k$.)

In particular, $\sigma(\zeta)$ satisfies the polynomial $x^n - 1$, since $\sigma(\zeta)^n = \sigma(\zeta^n) = \sigma(1) = 1$, which means $\sigma(\zeta)$ is another root of unity and $\sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^k$ for some $1\leq k \leq n$.

Moreover, since $o(\zeta) = n \in K\units$, we must have $o(\zeta^k) = n \in K\units$ as well. Noting that $\theset{\zeta^i}$ forms a cyclic subgroup $H\leq K\units$, then $o(\zeta^k) = n \iff (n, k) = 1$ (by general theory of cyclic groups).

Thus $\theta$ is surjective.

We have $K \cong \ZZ_{20}\units$ and $\phi(20) = 8$, so $K \cong \ZZ_8$, so we have the following subgroups and corresponding intermediate fields:

But $K/F$ is not Galois, since it is not the splitting field of any irreducible polynomial.
:::

:::{.proof title="of b"}
**True**: 
If $L/F$ is Galois, then $L/K$ is normal and separable:

- $L/K$ is normal, since if $\sigma: L \injects \overline K$ lifts the identity on $K$ and fixes $L$, i-t also lifts the identity on $F$ and fixes $L$ (and $\overline K = \overline F$).

- $L/K$ is separable, since $F[x] \subseteq K[x]$, and so if $\alpha \in L$ where $f(x) \definedas \min(\alpha, F)$ has no repeated factors, then $f'(x) \definedas \min(\alpha, K)$ divides $f$ and thus can not have repeated factors.

**False**: 
Use the fact that every quadratic extension is Galois, and take $L/K/F = \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2) \to \QQ(\sqrt 2) \to \QQ$.

- Reducible: $f\in \FF[x]$ is reducible iff there exists $g, h\in \FF[x]$ nonconstant with $f = g h$.

- WTS: $f(x) \da x^p - a\in \FF[x]$ reducible $\implies f$ has a root in the *base field* $\FF$.
- Write $f(x) = g(x) h(x)$ and factor $f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^p (x- r_i) \in \SF(f)[x]$ where the $r_i$ are not necessarily distinct roots.
- WLOG, $g(x) = \prod_{i=1}^\ell (x-r_i)$ for some $1\leq \ell \leq p-1$, i.e. rearrange the factors so that $g$ is the first $\ell$ of them.
  - $\ell \neq 1, p$ since $f$ is reducible, making $g, h$ nonconstant.

- Set $R_\ell \da \prod_{i=1}^\ell r_i$, which is the constant term in $g$, so $R_\ell \in \FF$ since $g\in \FF[x]$.

- Each $r_i$ is a root of $f$, so $r_i^p - a = 0$ for all $i$, so $r_i^p = a$.

- Trick: what is the $p$th power of $R_\ell$?
\[
R_\ell^p 
&\da \qty{ \prod_{i=1}^\ell}^p \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^\ell r_i^p \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^\ell a \\
&= a^\ell
,\]
  so $R_\ell^p = a^\ell$.

- Use Bezout: $\gcd(\ell, p) = 1$ since $p$ is prime, so write $tp + s\ell = 1$ for some $t,s\in \ZZ$

- Use this to build a root of $f$ that's in $\FF$: write
\[
a &= a^1\\
&= a^{tp + s\ell} \\
&= a^{tp} a^{s\ell} \\
&=a^{tp} (a^\ell)^s\\
&= a^{tp} (R_\ell^p)^s \\
&= (a^t R_\ell^s)^p \\
&\da \beta^p
,\]
  so $a = \beta^p$.

  - Check $\beta\in \FF$: use that $R_\ell \in \FF$ since it was a constant term of a polynomial in $\FF[x]$, $a\in \FF$ by assumption, and fields are closed under taking powers and products.

- Since $\abs{F} = q$ and $[E:F] = k$, we have $\abs{E} = q^k$ and $\abs{E\units} = q^k-1$.

- Noting that $\zeta \in E\units$ we must have $n = o(\zeta) \divides \abs{E\units} = q^k-1$ by Lagrange's theorem.

- Since $m\divides k \iff k = \ell m$, (**claim**) there is an intermediate subfield $M$ such that
\[
E \leq M \leq F \quad k = [F:E] = [F:M] [M:E] = \ell m
,\]

  so $M$ is a degree $m$ extension of $E$.

- Now consider $M\units$. 
- By the argument in (a), $n$ divides $q^m - 1 = \abs{M\units}$, and $M\units$ is cyclic, so it contains a cyclic subgroup $H$ of order $n$.

- But then $x\in H \implies p(x)\definedas x^n-1 = 0$, and since $p(x)$ has at most $n$ roots in a field. 

- So $H = \theset{x \in M \suchthat x^n-1 = 0}$, i.e. $H$ contains all solutions to $x^n-1$ in $E[x]$.

- But $\zeta$ is one such solution, so $\zeta \in H \subset M\units \subset M$.

- Since $F[\zeta]$ is the smallest field extension containing $\zeta$, we must have $F = M$, so $\ell = 1$, and $k = m$.

We can consider the quotient $K = \displaystyle{\frac{\FF_p[x]}{\generators{\pi(x)}}}$, which since $\pi(x)$ is irreducible is an extension of $\FF_p$ of degree $d$ and thus a field of size $p^d$ with a natural quotient map of rings $\rho: \FF_p[x] \to K$.

Since $K\units$ is a group of size $p^d-1$, we know that for any $y \in K\units$, we have by Lagrange's theorem that the order of $y$ divides $p^d-1$ and so $y^{p^d} = y$.

So every element in $K$ is a root of $q(x) = x^{p^d}-x$.

Since $\rho$ is a ring morphism, we have

\[
\rho(q(x)) = \rho(x^{p^d} - x) &= \rho(x)^{p^d} - \rho(x)
= 0 \in K \\
&\iff q(x) \in \ker \rho \\
&\iff q(x) \in \generators{\pi(x)} \\
&\iff \pi(x) \divides q(x) = x^{p^d}-x

Let $L \cong \GF(p^n)$ be the splitting field of $\phi_n(x) \definedas x^{p^n}-x$; then since $\pi \divides \phi_n$ by assumption, $\pi$ splits in $L$.
Let $\alpha \in L$ be any root of $\pi$; then there is a tower of extensions $\FF_p \leq \FF_p(\alpha) \leq L$.

Then $\FF_p \leq \FF_p(\alpha) \leq L$, and so
\[
n &= [L: \FF_p] \\

$\impliedby$:
If $d\divides n$, use the fact (claim) that $x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$.

- $\zeta \definedas e^{2\pi i / 8}$ is a primitive $8$th root of unity
- The minimal polynomial of an $n$th root of unity is the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_n$
- The degree of the field extension is the degree of $\Phi_8$, which is
\[
\phi(8) = \phi(2^3) = 2^{3-1} \cdot (2-1) = 4

- $\Gal(\QQ(\zeta)/\QQ) \cong \ZZ/(8)\units \cong \ZZ/(4)$ by general theory 
- $\ZZ/(4)$ has exactly one subgroup of index 2.

- Let $L = \QQ(\zeta, \sqrt[4] 2)$.

- Note $\QQ(\zeta) = \QQ(i, \sqrt 2)$
  - $\QQ(i, \sqrt{2})\subseteq \QQ(\zeta)$
    - $\zeta_8^2 = i$, and $\zeta_8 = \sqrt{2}\inv + i\sqrt{2}\inv$ so $\zeta_8 + \zeta_8 \inv = 2/\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}$.
  - $\QQ(\zeta) \subseteq \QQ(i, \sqrt{2})$: 
    - $\zeta = e^{2\pi i / 8} = \sin(\pi/4) + i\cos(\pi/4) = {\sqrt 2 \over 2}\qty{1+i}$.

- Thus $L = \QQ(i, \sqrt{2})(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \QQ(i, \sqrt 2, \sqrt[4] 2) = \QQ(i, \sqrt[4]{2})$.
  - Uses the fact that $\QQ(\sqrt 2) \subseteq \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)$ since $\sqrt[4]{2}^2 = \sqrt{2}$ 

- Conclude
\[
[L: \QQ] = [L: \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)] ~[\QQ(\sqrt[4] 2): \QQ] = 2 \cdot 4 = 8
\]
  using the fact that the minimal polynomial of $i$ over any subfield of $\RR$ is always $x^2 + 1$, so $\min_{\QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)}(i) = x^2 + 1$ which is degree 2.

By Cauchy's theorem, if $\abs{M/N} = ab$ is a composite number, then $a\divides ab \implies$ there is an element (and thus a subgroup) of order $a$.
In this case, $M/N$ contains a nontrivial proper cyclic subgroup, so $M/N$ is not simple.

  - Otherwise, if $H$ contains every $\zeta_{p^k}$ it contains every $\zeta_n$

Then there must be a prime $p$ such that the $\zeta_{p^k} \not \in H$ for all $k$ greater than some constant $m$ -- otherwise, we can use the fact that if $\zeta_{p^k} \in H$ then $\zeta_{p^\ell} \in H$ for all $\ell \leq k$, and if $\zeta_{p^k} \in H$ for all $p$ and all $k$ then $H = G$.

Let $R = \ZZ/6\ZZ$ as a $\ZZ/6\ZZ \dash$module, which is not an integral domain as a ring.

Then $[3]_6\actson [2]_6 = [0]_6$ and $[2]_6\actson [3]_6 = [0]_6$, but $[2]_6 + [3]_6 = [5]_6$, where 5 is coprime to 6, and thus $[n]_6\actson [5]_6 = [0] \implies [n]_6 = [0]_6$. So $[5]_6$ is *not* a torsion element.

So the set of torsion elements are not closed under addition, and thus not a submodule.

Suppose $R$ has zero divisors $a,b \neq 0$ where $ab = 0$.
Then for any $m\in M$, we have $b\actson m \definedas bm \in M$ as well, but then

\[  
\sum_{i=1}^n s_i \vector r_i = 0 \implies s_i = 0_R \,\forall i

- Let $\vector r$ be any of of these generating elements.
- Since $\vector r\in \tor(M)$, there exists an $s\in R\setminus 0_R$ such that $s\vector r = 0_M$.

- Suppose that
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n s_i (\vector r_i + \tor(M)) = \vector 0_{\tilde M}

- Then using the definition of coset addition/multiplication, we can write this as
\[  
\sum_{i=1}^n \qty { s_i \vector r_i + \tor(M)} = 
\qty{ \sum_{i=1}^n  s_i \vector r_i} + \tor(M)  = 0_{\tilde M}
.\]

- Since $\tilde{\vector x} = 0 \in \tilde M \iff \tilde{\vector x} = \vector x + \tor(M)$ where $\vector x \in \tor(M)$, this forces $\sum s_i \vector r_i \in \tor(M)$.

- Then there exists a scalar $\alpha\in R\nonzero$ such that $\alpha \sum s_i \vector r_i = 0_M$.

- Since $R$ is an integral domain and $\alpha \neq 0$, we must have $\sum s_i \vector r_i = 0_M$.

- Since $\theset{\vector r_i}$ was linearly independent in $M$, we must have $s_i = 0_R$ for all $i$.

- Since $\mathcal B$ is a basis for $M$, we have $\vector m = \sum_{i=1}^n s_i \vector r_i$, and so
\[
\vector x

- **Claim**: If $I\subseteq R$ is an ideal *and* a free $R\dash$module, then $I$ is principal .

  - Suppose $I$ is free and let $I = \generators{B}$ for some basis, we will show $\abs{B} = 1$>
  
  - Toward a contradiction, suppose $\abs{B} \geq 2$ and let $m_1, m_2\in B$.
  
  - Then  since $R$ is commutative, $m_2 m_1 - m_1 m_2 = 0$ and this yields a linear dependence
  
  - So $B$ has only one element $m$.

  - But then $I = \gens{m} = R_m$ is cyclic as an $R\dash$ module and thus principal as an ideal of $R$. 

  - Now since $M$ was assumed to *not* be principal, $M$ is not free (using the contrapositive of the claim).


:::

:::{.proof title="that $M$ is rank 1"}
\envlist

- For any module, we can take an element $\vector m\in M\nonzero$ and consider the cyclic submodule $R\vector m$.

- Since $M$ is not principle, it is not the zero ideal, and contains at least two elements. So we can consider an element $\vector m\in M$.

- We have $\rank_R(M) \geq 1$, since $R\vector m \leq M$ and $\theset{m}$ is a subset of some spanning set.

- $R\vector m$ can not be linearly dependent, since $R$ is an integral domain and $M\subseteq R$, so $\alpha \vector m = \vector 0 \implies \alpha = 0_R$.

- Claim: since $R$ is commutative, $\rank_R(M) \leq 1$.

  - If we take two elements $\vector m, \vector n \in M\nonzero$, then since $m, n\in R$ as well, we have $nm = mn$ and so
\[
(n)\vector m + (-m)\vector n = 0_R = \vector 0
\]
  is a linear dependence.

**$M$ is torsion-free**:

- Let $\vector x \in \tor M$, then there exists some $r\neq 0\in R$ such that $r\vector x = \vector 0$.

- But $\vector x\in R$ as well and $R$ is an integral domain, so $\vector x=0_R$, and thus $\tor(M) = \theset{0_R}$.

An $R\dash$module $M$ is **free** if any of the following conditions hold:

- $M$ admits a decomposition $M \cong \bigoplus_{\alpha} R$ as a direct sum of $R\dash$submodules.
- There is a nonempty set $X$ an monomorphism $X\injects M$ of sets such that for every $R\dash$module $N$, every set map $X\to N$ lifts to a unique $R\dash$module morphism $M\to N$, so the following diagram commutes:

- Let the following be an SES where $F$ is a free $R\dash$module:
\[
0 \to N \to M \mapsvia{\pi} F \to 0
.\]

- Since $F$ is free, there is a generating set $X = \theset{x_\alpha}$ and a map $\iota:X\injects F$ satisfying the 3rd property from (a).
  - If we construct any map $f: X\to M$, the universal property modules will give a lift $\tilde f: F\to M$

- Identify $X$ with $\iota(X) \subseteq F$. 
- For every $x\in X$, the preimage $\pi\inv(x)$ is nonempty by surjectivity.
  So arbitrarily pick any preimage.
- $\theset{\iota(x_\alpha)} \subseteq F$ and $\pi$ is surjective, so choose fibers $\theset{y_\alpha} \subseteq M$ such that $\pi(y_\alpha) = \iota(x_\alpha)$ and define
\[
f: X&\to M \\
x_\alpha &\mapsto y_\alpha
.\]
- The universal property yields $h: F\to M$:

\begin{tikzcd}
& & & X=\theset{x_\alpha} \ar[dd, hook, "\iota"]\ar[ddl, "f"'] &  \\ \\
0 \ar[r]& N \ar[r] & M\ar[r, "\pi"'] & \ar[l, bend right, dotted ,"\exists ! h"'] F \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}

- It remains to check that it's a section.
  - Write $f= \sum r_i x_i$, then since both maps are $R\dash$module morphism, by $R\dash$linearity we can write
  \[
  (\pi \circ h)(f) 
  &= (\pi \circ h)\qty{ \sum r_i x_i } \\
  &= \sum r_i (\pi \circ h)(x_i)
  ,\]
  but since $h(x_i) \in \pi\inv(x_i)$, we have $(\pi \circ h)(x_i) = x_i$.
  So this recovers $f$.

If $A \in \Gl(m, \FF)$ is invertible and $A^n/\FF$ is diagonalizable, then $A/\FF$ is diagonalizable.
:::


:::{.proof title="of claim"}
- Let $A \in \Gl(m, \FF)$. 
- Since $A^n$ is diagonalizable, $\min_{A^n}(x) \in \FF[x]$ is separable and thus factors as a product of $m$ **distinct** linear factors:
\[
\min_{A^n}(x) = \prod_{i=1}^m (x-\lambda_i), \quad \min_{A^n}(A^n) = 0
\]

  where $\theset{\lambda_i}_{i=1}^m \subset \FF$ are the **distinct** eigenvalues of $A^n$.

- Moreover $A\in \GL(m,\FF) \implies A^n \in \GL(m,\FF)$: $A$ is invertible $\iff \det(A) = d \in \FF\units$, and so $\det(A^n) = \det(A)^n = d^n \in \FF\units$ using the fact that the determinant is a ring morphism $\det: \mat (m\times m) \to\FF$ and $\FF\units$ is closed under multiplication.

- So $A^n$ is invertible, and thus has trivial kernel, and thus zero is not an eigenvalue, so $\lambda_i \neq 0$ for any $i$.

- Since the $\lambda_i$ are distinct and nonzero, this implies $x^k$ is not a factor of $\mu_{A^n}(x)$ for any $k\geq 0$. 
Thus the $m$ terms in the product correspond to precisely $m$ **distinct linear** factors.

- We can now construct a polynomial that annihilates $A$, namely
$$
q_A(x) \definedas \min_{A^n}(x^n) = \prod_{i=1}^m (x^n-\lambda_i) \in \FF[x],
$$

  where we can note that $q_A(A) = \min_{A^n}(A^n) = 0$, and so $\min_A(x) \divides q_A(x)$ by minimality.


:::{.claim}
$q_A(x)$ has exactly $nm$ distinct linear factors in $\FFbar[x]$
:::


- This reduces to showing that no pair $x^n-\lambda_i, x^n-\lambda_j$ share a root.
and that $x^n-\lambda_i$ does not have multiple roots.

- For the first claim, we can factor
  \[
  x^n - \lambda_i = \prod_{k=1}^n (x - \lambda_i^{1\over n} e^{2\pi i k \over n}) \definedas \prod_{k=1}^n (x-\lambda^{1\over n} \zeta_n^k)
  ,\]
  where we now use the fact that $i\neq j \implies \lambda_i^{1\over n} \neq \lambda_j^{1\over n}$. 
  Thus no term in the above product appears as a factor in $x^n - \lambda_j$ for $j\neq i$.

- For the second claim, we can check that $\dd{}{x}\qty{x^n - \lambda_i} = nx^{n-1}\neq 0\in \FF$, and $\gcd(x^n-\lambda_i, nx^{n-1}) = 1$ since the latter term has only the roots $x=0$ with multiplicity $n-1$, whereas $\lambda_i\neq 0 \implies$ zero is not a root of $x^n-\lambda_i$.

But now since $q_A(x)$ has exactly distinct linear factors in $\bar \FF[x]$ and $\min_A(x) \divides q_A(x)$, $\min_A(x) \in \FF[x]$ can only have distinct linear factors, and $A$ is thus diagonalizable over $\FF$.

A *symmetric bilinear form* $(\wait, \wait)$ on $V$ is a map $V\cross V\to F$ satisfying

The form is *nondegenerate* if the only element $w\in V$ satisfying $(v, w) = 0$ for all $v\in V$ is $w=0$.

##  Fall 2018 #4 $\done$ 
Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a field (the field is not necessarily algebraically closed).

Let $\phi : V \to V$ be a linear transformation. Prove that there exists a decomposition of $V$ as $V = U \oplus W$ , where $U$ and $W$ are $\phi\dash$invariant subspaces of $V$ , $\restrictionof{\phi}{U}$ is nilpotent, and $\restrictionof{\phi}{W}$ is nonsingular.

\todo[inline]{Revisit.}

:::{.solution}
Let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\phi$.
If the polynomial $f(x) = x$ doesn't divide $m$, then $f$ does not have zero as an eigenvalue, so $\phi$ is nonsingular and since $0$ is nilpotent, $\phi + 0$ works.

Otherwise, write $\phi(x) = x^m \rho(x)$ where $\gcd(x, \rho(x)) = 1$.

Then
\[
V \cong \frac{k[x]}{m(x)} \cong \frac{k[x]}{(x^m)} \oplus \frac{k[x]}{(\rho)}
\definedas U \oplus W
\]
by the Chinese Remainder theorem.

We can now note that $\restrictionof{\phi}{U}$ is nilpotent because it has characteristic polynomial $x^m$, and $\restrictionof{\phi}{W}$ is nonsingular since $\lambda = 0$ is not an eigenvalue by construction.

Letting $\vector v$ be fixed, since $\theset{A^j \vector v}$ spans $V$ we have A
\[
B\vector v = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_j A^j \vector v
.\]

So let $p(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_jx^j$.
Then consider how $B$ acts on any basis vector $A^k \vector v$.

We have 
\[
BA^k \vector v 
&= A^k B\vector v \\
&= A^k p(A) \vector v \\
&= p(A) A^k \vector v
,\]

so $B = p(A)$ as operators since their actions agree on every basis vector in $V$.

- If $\theset{A^j \vector v_k \suchthat 0\leq j \leq n-1}$ is linearly independent, this means that $A$ does satisfy any polynomial of degree $d < n$.

- So $\deg m_A(x) = n$, and since $m_A(x)$ divides $\chi_A(x)$ and both are monic degree polynomials of degree $n$, they must be equal.
:::

:::{.proof title="of b, $\impliedby$"}
\envlist

- Let $A\actson k[x]$ by $A \actson p(x) \definedas p(A)$.
  This induces an invariant factor decomposition $V =\cong \bigoplus k[x]/(f_i)$.

- Since the product of the invariant factors is the characteristic polynomial, the largest invariant factor is the minimal polynomial, and these two are equal, there can only be one invariant factor and thus the invariant factor decomposition is
$$
V\cong \frac{k[x]}{(\chi_A(x))}
$$
  as an isomorphism of $k[x]\dash$modules.

- So $V$ is a cyclic $k[x]$ module, which means that $V = k[x]\actson \vector v$ for some $\vector v\in V$ such that $\ann(\vector v) = \chi_A(x)$, i.e. there is some element $\vector v\in V$ whose orbit is all of $V$.

- But then noting that monomials span $k[x]$ as a $k\dash$module, we can write
\[
V &\cong
k[x] \actson \vector v \\
&\definedas \theset{f(x) \actson \vector v \suchthat f \in k[x]} \\
&= \spanof_k \theset{x^k \actson \vector v \suchthat k \geq 0} \\
&\definedas \spanof_k \theset{A^k\vector v \suchthat k \geq 0}
,\]
  where we've used that $x$ acts by $A$ and thus $x^k$ acts by $A^k$.

- Moreover, we can note that if $\ell \geq \deg \chi_A(x)$, then $A^\ell$ is a linear combination of $\theset{A^j \mid 0 \leq j \leq n-1}$, and so
\[
V &\cong \spanof_k \theset{A^\ell\vector v \suchthat \ell \geq 0} \\
&= \spanof_k \theset{A^\ell \vector v \suchthat 1 \leq \ell \leq n-1}

$\implies$:

- By contrapositive, suppose there is a proper nonzero invariant subspace $W<V$ with $T(W) \subseteq W$, we will show the characteristic polynomial $f \definedas \chi_{V, T}(x)$ is reducible.

  - Note that since $W<V$ is proper, $j\geq 1$.
- Restrict $T$ to $W$ to get $T_W$, then let $B = [T_W]_{\mcb_W}$ be the matrix representation of $T_W$ with respect to $\mcb_W$.
- Now consider the matrix representation $[T]_{\mcb_V}$, in block form this is given by
\[
[T]_{\mcb_V} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
B & C \\
0 & D
\end{bmatrix}
\]
  where we've used that $W<V$ is proper to get the existence of $C, D$ (there is at least one additional row/column since $j\geq 1$ in the extended basis.)
\todo[inline]{Why?}

- Now expand along the first column block to obtain
\[
\chi_{T, V}(x) \definedas \det([T]_{\mcb_V} - xI) = \det(B - xI)\cdot \det(D - xI) \definedas \chi_{T, W}(x) \cdot \det(D-xI)

- Claim: $\det(D - xI) \in xF[x]$ is nontrivial

- The claim follows because this forces $\deg(\det(D-xI)) \geq 1$ and so $\chi_{T, W}(x)$ is a proper divisor of $\chi_{T, V}(x)$.

- Let $\min_{T, F}(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $T$ and $\chi_{T, F}(x)$ be its characteristic polynomial.

- Since $\chi_{T, F}$ is irreducible, these polynomials are equal.
- Claim: $T/F$ is diagonalizable $\iff \min_{T, F}$ splits over $F$ and is squarefree.
- Replace $F$ with its algebraic closure, then $\min_{T, F}$ splits.
- Claim: in characteristic zero, every irreducible polynomial is separable
  - Proof: it must be the case that either $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ or $f' \equiv 0$, where the second case only happens in characteristic $p>0$.
  - The first case is true because $\deg f' < \deg f$, and if $\gcd(f, f') = p$, then $\deg p < \deg f$ and $p\divides f$ forces $p=1$ since $f$ is irreducible.
- So $\min_{T, F}$ splits into distinct linear factors
- Thus $T$ is diagonalizable.

**Proof of (a)**:
Let $A$ be the matrix in the question, and $B$ be the matrix containing 1's in every entry.

- Noting that $B = A+I$, we have
  \[
  &B\vector x = \lambda \vector x \\
  &\iff (A+I) \vector x = \lambda \vector x \\
  &\iff A \vector x = (\lambda - 1) \vector x
  ,\]
    so we will find the eigenvalues of $B$ and subtract one from each.

- Note that $B\vector v = \thevector{\sum v_i, \sum v_i, \cdots, \sum v_i}$, i.e. it has the effect of summing all of the entries of $\vector v$ and placing that sum in each component.

- We proceed by finding $p$ eigenvectors and eigenvalues, since the JCF and minimal polynomials will involve eigenvalues and the transformation matrix will involve (generalized) eigenvectors.

:::{.claim title="1"}

:::

:::{.claim title="2"}
$\vector v_1 = \thevector{1, 1, \cdots, 1}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = p$.
:::

- Using that the eigenvalues of $A$ are $1+\lambda_i$ for $\lambda_i$ the above eigenvalues for $B$,
\[
\spec(B) \definedas \theset{(\lambda_i, m_i)} &=  \theset{(p, 1), (0, p-1)}  \implies \chi_{B}(x) = (x-p)x^{p-1} \\ 
\implies \spec(A) &= \theset{(p-1,1), (-1, p-1) }  \implies \chi_{A}(x) = (x- p+1)(x+1)^{p-1} \\
\]

- The dimensions of eigenspaces are preserved, thus
\[
JCF_\QQ(A)
=  J_{p-1}^{1} \oplus (p-1)J_{-1}^1

\left[\begin{array}{r|r|r|r|r|r}

- The matrix $P$ such that $A = PJP\inv$ will have columns the bases of the generalized eigenspaces.

- Compute $$B \vector p_i = \thevector{ 1 + 0 + \cdots + 0 + (-1) + 0 + \cdots + 0} = \thevector{0, 0, \cdots, 0}$$
- So every $\vector p_i \in \ker(B)$, so they are eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0.
- Since the first component is fixed and we have $p-1$ choices for where to place a $-1$, this yields $p-1$ possibilities for $\vector p_i$
- These are linearly independent since the $(p-1)\times (p-1)$ matrix $\thevector{ \vector p_1^t, \cdots, \vector p_{p-1}^t}$ satisfies

- Compute $$B\vector v = \thevector{\sum_{i=1}^p 1, \sum_{i=1}^p 1, \cdots, \sum_{i=1}^p 1} = \thevector{p, p, \cdots, p} = p \thevector{1, 1, \cdots, 1} = p\vector{v}_1,$$ thus $\lambda_1 = p$
- $\dim E_{\lambda_1} = 1$ since the eigenspaces are orthogonal and $E_{\lambda_0} \oplus E_{\lambda_1} \leq F^p$ is a subspace, so $p > \dim(E_{\lambda_0}) + \dim E_{\lambda_1} = p-1 + \dim E_{\lambda_1}$ and it isn't zero dimensional.

:::

**Proof of (b)**:

For $F = \FF_p$, all eigenvalues/vectors still lie in $\FF_p$, but now $-1 = p-1$, making $(x-(p-1))(x+1)^{p-1} = (x+1)(x+1)^{p-1}$, so $\chi_{A, \FF_p}(x) = (x+1)^p$, and the Jordan blocks may merge.

- A computation shows that $(A+I)^2 = pA = 0 \in M_p(\FF_p)$ and $(A+I) \neq 0$, so $\min_{A, \FF_p}(x) = (x+1)^2$.
  - Thus the largest Jordan block corresponding to $\lambda = -1$ is of size 2
- Can check that $\det(A) = \pm 1 \in \FF_p\units$, so the vectors $\vector e_1 - \vector e_i$ are still linearly independent and thus $\dim E_{-1} = p-1$
  - So there are $p-1$ Jordan blocks for $\lambda = 0$.

Summary:
\[
\min_{A, \FF_p}(x) &= (x+1)^2 \\
\chi_{A, \FF_p}(x) &\equiv (x+1)^p \\
\dim E_{-1} &= p-1
.\]

Thus
\[
JCF_{\FF_p}(A)
=  J_{-1}^{2} \oplus (p-2)J_{-1}^1
= \left[\begin{array}{rr|r|r|r|r}
-1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0& -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0& 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & -1 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\]

To obtain a basis for $E_{\lambda = 0}$, first note that the matrix $P = [\vector v_1, \vector p_1, \cdots , \vector p_{p-1}]$ from part (a) is singular over $\FF_p$, since
\[
\vector v_1 + \vector p_1 + \vector p_2 + \cdots + \vector p_{p-2}
&= [p-1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0, 1] \\
&= [-1, 0,0,\cdots, 0, 1] \\
&= - \vector p_{p-1}
.\]

We still have a linearly independent set given by the first $p-1$ columns of $P$, so we can extend this to a basis by finding one linearly independent generalized eigenvector.

Solving $(A-I\lambda)\vector x = \vector v_1$ is our only option (the others won't yield solutions).
This amounts to solving $B\vector x = \vector v_1$, which imposes the condition $\sum x_i = 1$, so we can choose $\vector x = [1, 0, \cdots, 0]$.

Thus
\[
P = [\vector v_1, \vector x, \vector p_1, \cdots, \vector p_{p-2}] =
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  \\
1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}\right]

- Write $\chi_A(t) = t^3 - T_1 t^2 + T_2 t - T_3$ where $T_i \da \tr\qty{\Extpower^i A}$:
  - $T_1 = \tr(A) = 4-1+1=4$.
  - $T_2 = (-1-2) + (4+2) + (-4-6) = 5$.
  - $T_3 = \det(A) = 4(-1-2) -1(-10) + (-1)(-6+2) = 2$.
- So $\chi_A(t) = t^3 - 4t^2 + 5t-2$.
- Try rational roots test: $r \in \ts{\pm 2/1}$, and check that 2 is root.
- By polynomial long division, $\chi_A(t) / (t-2) = t^2-2t+1 = (t-1)^2$.
- So the eigenvalues are $\lambda = 2, 1$.
- $\lambda = 2$:
  - Set $U\da A-\lambda I$, then find $\RREF(U)$ to compute its kernel:
  \[
  U \da
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 & -1
  \\
  -6 & -3 & 2
  \\
  2 & 1 & -1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \leadsto
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 & 0
  \\
  0 & 0 & 1
  \\
  0 & 0 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
  ,\]
  which yields $v_1 = [1,-2,0]$.

- $\lambda = 2$:
  - Similarly,
  \[
  U \da 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  3 & 1 & -1 \\
  -6 & -2 & 2 \\
  2 & 1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
  \leadsto  
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & -1
  \\
  0 & 1 & 2
  \\
  0 & 0 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
  ,\]
  which yields $v_2 = [1,-2,1]$.

  - Solve $Uw = v_3$:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  3 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
  -6 & -2 & 2 & -2 \\
  2 & 1 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \leadsto
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
  ,\]
  so take $v_3 = [0,1,0]$.

- Putting things together:
\[
A &= P\inv J P \text{ where } \\
J = J_1(\lambda = 2) \oplus J_2(\lambda = 1) 
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0
\\
0 & 1 & 1
\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \\
P = [v_1, v_2, v_3] 
&= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0
\\
-2 & -2 & 1

0 & 1 & 0

- Write $\min_A(t) = (t-2)(t-1)^{\ell_1}$, then since $\min_A(t)$ divides $\chi_A(t)$ either $\ell_1 = 1, 2$.
- $\ell_1$ is the size of the **largest** block corresponding to $\lambda = 1$, which is size 2, so $\lambda_1=2$.

\min_A(t) = (t-2)(t-1)^2
