# Group Theory: General

## Cosets

### Spring 2020 \#2 \( \done \) {#spring-2020-2-done}

Let \( H \) be a normal subgroup of a finite group \( G \) where the order of \( H \) and the index of \( H \) in \( G \) are relatively prime. Prove that no other subgroup of \( G \) has the same order as \( H \).

Recognize that it suffices to show \( hN = N \). Context cue: coprimality hints at division algorithm. Descend to quotient so you can leverage both the order of \( h \) *and* the order of cosets simultaneously.

-   For ease of notation, replace \( H \) in the problem with \( N \) so we remember which one is normal.
-   Write \( n\coloneqq\# N \) and \( m \coloneqq[G:N] = \#G/N \), where the quotient makes sense since \( N \) is normal.
-   Let \( H \leq G \) with \( \# H = n \), we'll show \( H=N \).
    -   Since \( \# H = \# N \) it suffices to show \( H \subseteq N \).
    -   It further suffices to show \( hN = N \) for all \( h\in H \).
-   Noting \( \gcd(m, n)=1 \), use the division algorithm to write \( 1 = ns + mt \) for some \( s,t\in {\mathbb{Z}} \).
-   The result follows from a computation:
    \[
    hN 
    &= h^1 N \\
    &= h^{ns + mt}N \\
    &= h^{ns} N \cdot h^{mt}N \\
    &= \qty{h^n N}^s \cdot \qty{h^t N}^m \\
    &= (eN)^s \cdot N \\
    &= N
    ,\]
    -   We've used that \( h\in H \implies o(h) \bigm|\# H = n \) by Lagrange, so \( h^n = e \).
    -   We've also used that \( \# G/N = m \), so \( (xH)^m = H \) for any \( xH\in G/H \).

### Fall 2014 \#6 \( \done \) {#fall-2014-6-done}

Let \( G \) be a group and \( H, K < G \) be subgroups of finite index. Show that

-   For \( H, K\leq G \), intersection is again a subgroup of everything: \( H\int K \leq H, K, G \) by the one-step subgroup test.

-   Fundamental theorem of cosets: \( xH = yH \iff xy^{-1}\in H \).

-   \( H \cap K \leq H \leq G \implies [G: H \cap K] = [G: H] [H : H \cap K] \)
-   So it suffices to show \( [H: H \cap K] \leq [G: K] \)
-   Write \( H/H \cap K = \left\{{ h_1 J, \cdots, h_m J }\right\} \) as distinct cosets where \( J \coloneqq H \cap J \).
-   Then \( h_i J\neq h_j J \iff h_i h_j^{-1}\not\in J = H \cap K \).
-   \( H \) is a subgroup, so \( h_i h_j^{-1}\in H \) forces this not to be in \( K \).
-   But then \( h_i K \neq h_j K \), so these are distinct cosets in \( G/K \).
-   So \( \#G/K \geq m \).

### Spring 2013 \#3 \( \done \) {#spring-2013-3-done}

Let \( P \) be a finite \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group. Prove that every nontrivial normal subgroup of \( P \) intersects the center of \( P \) nontrivially.

```{=tex}
\todo[inline]{Clean up, sketchy argument.}
```
::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Let \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}P \), then for each conjugacy class \( [n_i] \) in \( N \), \( H \cap[g_i] = [g_i] \) or is empty.
-   \( G = {\textstyle\coprod}_{i\leq M} [g_i] \) is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes, and the conjugacy classes of \( H \) are of the form \( [g_i] \cap H \).
-   Then pull out the center
    \[
    H = \displaystyle\coprod_{i\leq M} [g_i] \cap H = \qty{ Z(G) \cap H } {\textstyle\coprod}\displaystyle\coprod_{i\leq M'} [g_i]
    .\]
-   Taking cardinalities,
    \[
    \# H = \# \qty{ Z(G) \cap H} + \sum_{i\leq M'} \# [g_i]
    .\]
-   \( p \) divides \( H \) since \( H\leq P \) and \( P \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group.
-   Each \( \# [g_i] \geq 2 \) since the trivial conjugacy classes appear in the center, forcing \( \# [g_i] \geq p \).
-   \( p \) divides \( \# [g_i] \) since \( \# [g_i] \) must divide \( \# P = p^k \)
-   So \( p \) must divide the remaining term \( Z(G) \cap H \), which makes it nontrivial.

## Burnside / Class Equation

### Spring 2019 \#4 \( \done \) {#spring-2019-4-done}

For a finite group \( G \), let \( c(G) \) denote the number of conjugacy classes of \( G \).

a.  Prove that if two elements of \( G \) are chosen uniformly at random,then the probability they commute is precisely
    \[
    \frac{c(G)}{{\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert}}
    .\]

b.  State the class equation for a finite group.

c.  Using the class equation (or otherwise) show that the probability in part (a) is at most
    \[
    \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 {2[G : Z(G)]}
    .\]

> Here, as usual, \( Z(G) \) denotes the center of \( G \).

Fixed points of the conjugation action are precisely commuting elements. Apply Burnside. Context clue: \( 1/[G:Z(G)] \) is weird, right? Use that \( [G:Z(G)] = \# G/\# Z(G) \), so try to look for \( \#Z(G)/\#(G) \) somewhere. Count sizes of centralizers.

-   Define a sample space \( \Omega = G \times G \), so \( \# {\Omega} = (\# {G})^2 \).

-   Identify the event we want to analyze:
    \[
    A \coloneqq\left\{{(g,h) \in G\times G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}[g,h] = 1}\right\} \subseteq \Omega
    .\]

-   Note that the slices are centralizers:
    \[
    A_g \coloneqq\left\{{(g, h) \in \left\{{ g }\right\} \times G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}[g, h] = 1}\right\} = Z(g) \implies A = \displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} Z(g)
    .\]

-   Set \( n \) be the number of conjugacy classes, note we want to show \( P(A) = n / {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} \).

-   Let \( G \) act on itself by conjugation, which partitions \( G \) into conjugacy classes.

    -   What are the orbits?
        \[
        \mathcal{O}_g = \left\{{hgh^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}h\in G}\right\}
        ,\]
        which is the **conjugacy class** of \( g \). In particular, the number of orbits is the number of conjugacy classes.

    -   What are the fixed points?
        \[X^g = \left\{{h\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}hgh^{-1}= g}\right\},\]
        which are the elements of \( G \) that commute with \( g \), which is isomorphic to \( A_g \).

-   Identifying centralizers with fixed points,
    \[
    \#{A} = \#{\displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} Z(g) } = \sum_{g\in G} \#{Z(g)} = \sum_{g\in G}\# {X^g}
    .\]

-   Apply Burnside
    \[
    \# {X / G} = \frac { 1 } { \# G  } \sum _ { g \in G } \# X ^ { g } ,
    \]

-   Note \( \#{X/G} = n \), i.e.Â the number of conjugacy classes is the number of orbits.

-   Rearrange and use definition:
    \[
    n \cdot \#{G}
    = \qty{\#{X/G} }\cdot \#{G}
    = \sum _ { g \in G } \# X ^ { g } 
    \]

-   Compute probability:
    \[
    P(A)
    = {\# A \over \# \Omega} 
    =  \displaystyle\sum _{ g \in G } \frac{\# X ^ { g }}{ ( \# {G} )^2} 
    = \frac{\qty{ \# {X/G}} \cdot \#{G}}{ (\#{G})^2}

    = \frac n {\# G}

where \( Z(x) = \left\{{g\in G {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}[g, x] = 1}\right\} \) is the centralizer of \( x \) in \( G \).

> (DZG): I couldn't convince myself that a previous proof using the class equation actually works. Instead, I'll borrow the proof from [this note](https://math.berkeley.edu/~tb65536/Commuting_Probability.pdf)

-   Write the event as \( A = \displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} \left\{{g}\right\} \times Z(g) \), then
    \[
    P(A) 
    = {\# A\over (\# G)^2} 
    = {1\over (\# G)^2} \sum_{g\in G} \# Z(g)
    .\]
-   Attempt to estimate the sum: pull out central elements \( g\in Z(G) \).
    -   Note \( Z(g) = G \) for central \( g \), so \( \# Z(g) = \# G \)
    -   Note
        \[
        g\not\in Z(G)\implies \# Z(g) \leq {1\over 2} \# G
        ,\]
        since \( Z(g) \leq G \) is a subgroup, and
        \[
        [G:Z(g)] \neq 1 \implies [G: Z(g)] \geq 2
        .\]
-   Use these facts to calculate:
    \[
    P(A) 
    &= {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \sum_{g\in Z(g)} \# Z(g) + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} \# Z(g) } \\

    &= {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \# Z(G) \cdot \# G + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} \# Z(g) } \\
    &\leq {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \# Z(G) \cdot \# G + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} {1\over 2} \# G } \\
    &= {1\over (\# G)^2 } \qty{ \# Z(G) \cdot \# G + \qty{ \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} {1\over 2} } \cdot \# G } \\
    &= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ \# Z(G) + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} {1\over 2} } \\
    &= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ \# Z(G) + {1\over 2} \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} 1 } \\
    &= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ \# Z(G) + {1\over 2} \#(G \setminus Z(G) ) } \\
    &= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ \# Z(G) + {1\over 2} \#G - {1\over 2} \# Z(G) } \\
    &= {1\over (\# G) } \qty{ {1\over 2} \# Z(G) + {1\over 2} \#G  } \\
    &= {1\over 2} \qty{1 + { \# Z(G) \over \# G }} \\

## Group Actions / Representations

### Spring 2017 \#1 \( \done \) {#spring-2017-1-done}

Let \( G \) be a finite group and \( \pi: G\to \operatorname{Sym}(G) \) the Cayley representation.

> (Recall that this means that for an element \( x\in G \), \( \pi(x) \) acts by left translation on \( G \).)

Prove that \( \pi(x) \) is an odd permutation \( \iff \) the order \( {\left\lvert {\pi(x)} \right\rvert} \) of \( \pi(x) \) is even and \( {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} / {\left\lvert {\pi(x)} \right\rvert} \) is odd.

::: {.warnings}
(DZG): This seems like an unusually hard group theory problem. My guess is this year's qual class spent more time than usual on the proof of Cayley's theorem.
:::

-   \( \operatorname{Sym}(G) \coloneqq{\operatorname{Aut}}_{\mathsf{Set}}(G, G) \) is the group of set morphisms from \( G \) to itself, i.e.Â permutations of elements of \( G \).
-   More standard terminology: this is related to the **left regular representation** where \( g\mapsto \phi_g \) where \( \phi_g(x) = gx \), regarded instead as a permutation representation.
    -   This action is transitive!
-   Cayley's theorem: every \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation group. In particular, take \( \left\{{ \phi_g {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}G\in G }\right\} \) with function composition as a subgroup of \( {\operatorname{Aut}}_{\mathsf{Set}}(G) \).
:::

> (DZG): Warning!! I haven't checked this solution very carefully, and this is kind of a delicate parity argument. Most of the key ideas are borrowed [from here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3028603/show-that-phig-is-an-even-permutation).

-   Write \( k \coloneqq o(\pi_g) \), then since \( \pi \) is injective, \( k = o(g) \) in \( G \).
-   Since \( \pi_g \) as a cycle is obtained from the action of \( g \), we can pick an element \( x_0 \) in \( G \), take the orbit under the action, and obtain a cycle of length \( k \) since the order of \( g \) is \( k \). Then continue by taking any \( x_1 \) not in the first orbit and taking *its* orbit. Continuing this way exhausts all group elements and yields a decomposition into disjoint cycles:
    \[
    \pi_g = 
    (x_0, gx_0, g^2 x_0, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_0)
    (x_1, gx_1, g^2 x_1, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_1)
    \cdots
    (x_m, gx_m, g^2 x_m, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_m)
    .\]
-   So there are \( m \) orbits all of length exactly \( k \). Proceed by casework.
-   If \( k \) is even:
    -   This yields \( m \) odd cycles, and thus \( \pi \) has zero (an even number) of even cycles.
    -   Thus \( \pi \in \ker \operatorname{sgn} \) and is an even permutation.
-   If \( k \) is odd
    -   This yields \( m \) even cycles, thus an even number of even cycles iff \( m \) is even
-   The claim is that the number of orbit representatives \( m \) is equal to \( [G:H] = \# G/H \) for \( H = \left\langle{ g }\right\rangle \).
    -   Proof: define a map
        \[
        \left\{{ \text{Orbit representatives } x_i }\right\} &\to G/H \\
        x &\mapsto xH
        .\]
    -   This is injective and surjective because
        \[
        xH = yH &\iff xy^{-1}\in H = \left\langle{ g }\right\rangle \\
        &\iff xy^{-1}= g^\ell \\
        &\iff x=g^\ell y \\
        &\iff y\in {\mathcal{O}}_x
        ,\]
        so \( y \) and \( x \) are in the same orbit and have the same orbit representative.
-   We now have
    \[
    \pi_g \text{ is an even permutation } \iff 
    \begin{cases}
    k \text{ is odd and } m \text{ is even} &  
    \\
    \text{ or } & \\
    k \text{ is even}
     & .
    \end{cases}
    \]
-   Everything was an iff, so flip the evens to odds:
    \[
    \pi_g \text{ is an odd permutation } \iff 
    \begin{cases}
    k \text{ is even and } m \text{ is odd} &  
    \\
    \text{ or } & \\
    k \text{ is odd}
     & .
    \end{cases}
    .\]
-   Then just recall that \( k\coloneqq o(\pi_g) \) and
    \[
    m= [G: \left\langle{ g }\right\rangle] = \# G / \# \left\langle{ g }\right\rangle= \# G / o(g) = \# G/ o(\pi_g)

1.  Normal subgroups are disjoint unions of (some) conjugacy classes in \( G \).

-   In fact, this is a characterization of normal subgroups (i.e.Â \( H \) is normal iff a union of conjugacy classes).

2.  Orbit stabilizer theorem: \( \# C_g = \# G/ \# K_g \) where \( C_g \) is the centralizer and \( K_g \) is the conjugacy class of \( g \). In particular, \( \# C_g \) divides \( \#G \).

-   Let \( p \coloneqq\#H \).

-   Let \( \left\{{ C_i }\right\}_{i\leq n} \) be the conjugacy classes in \( G \), then \( G = {\textstyle\coprod}_{i\leq n} C_i \)

-   By the first fact, there is a sub-collection \( \left\{{ C_{i_j}}\right\}_{j\leq k } \) such that
    \[
    H = {\textstyle\coprod}_{j\leq k} C_{i_j}
    .\]

-   The identity is always in a single conjugacy class, so \( C_e = \left\{{ e }\right\} \).

-   Since \( e\in H \), without loss of generality, label \( C_{i_1} = \left\{{ e }\right\} \).

-   So
    \[
    H 
    = {\textstyle\coprod}_{j\leq k} C_{i_j} 
    = C_{i_1}{\textstyle  \coprod} \displaystyle\displaystyle\coprod_{\substack{ j\leq k \\ j\neq 1} } C_{i_j} 
    .\]

-   Take cardinality in the above equation
    \[
    p = 1 + \sum_{\substack{ j\leq k \\ j\neq 1 }} \# C_{i_j}
    .\]

-   So \( \# C_{i_j} \leq p-1 \) for all \( j\neq 1 \).

-   Every \( \# C_{i_j} \) divides \( \# G \), but \( p \) was the *minimal* prime dividing \( \# G \), forcing \( \# C_{i_j} = 1 \) for all \( j \neq 1 \).

    -   This rules out \( \# C_{i_j} \) being a prime less than \( p \), but also rules out composites: if a prime \( q\bigm|\# C_{i_j} \), then \( q<p \) and \( q\bigm|\# G \), a contradiction.

-   By fact 3, each \( x\in C_{i_j} \) satisfies \( x\in Z(G) \).

-   \( \cup C_{i_j} = H \), so \( H \subseteq Z(G) \).

    p = \# N = \sum_{i=1}^m \# [n_i] = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^m [n_i]
    .\]
-   The size of each conjugacy class divides the size of \( H \) by orbit-stabilizer, so \( \# [n_i] \bigm|p \) for each \( i \).
-   But the entire second term must sum to \( p-1 \) for this equality to hold, which forces \( \#[n_i] = 1 \) (and incidentally \( m=p-1 \))
-   Then \( [n_i] = \left\{{ n_i }\right\} \iff n_i \in Z(G) \), and this holds for all \( i \), so \( N \subseteq Z(G) \).

Let \( G \) be a nonabelian group of order \( p^3 \) for \( p \) prime. Show that \( Z(G) = [G, G] \).

> Note: this is a good problem, it tests several common theorems at once. Proof due to Paco Adajar.

Important notations and definitions:

-   The **center** of \( G \), denoted by \( Z(G) \), is the subset of elements of \( G \) which commute with all elements of \( G \). That is, if \( x \in Z(G) \), then for all \( g \in G \), \( gx = xg \):
    \[Z(G) = \{ x \in G : gx = xg \, \text{for all } g \in G \}.\]

    In fact, \( Z(G) \) is not just a subset of \( G \), but a normal subgroup of \( G \).

-   The **commutator subgroup** of \( G \), denoted by \( [G, G] \), is the subgroup of \( G \) generated by the commutators of \( G \), i.e., the elements of the form \( ghg^{-1}h^{-1} \):
    \[[G, G] = \langle ghg^{-1}h^{-1} : g, h \in G \rangle.\]

    The commutator subgroup \( [G,G] \) is the smallest normal subgroup of \( G \) whose quotient is abelian. That is, if \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \) for which \( G/H \) is abelian, then \( [G, G] \le H \).

    Moreover, \( G \) is abelian if and only if \( [G,G] \) is trivial.

Theorems to remember and know how to prove:

-   **\( G/Z(G) \) Theorem**: If \( G/Z(G) \) is cyclic, then \( G \) is abelian, i.e., \( G/Z(G) \) is in fact trivial.

-   **Lagrange's Theorem**: If \( G \) is a group of finite order and \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \), then the order of \( H \) divides that of \( G \).

    -   One consequence of this is that every group of prime order is cyclic.

-   A \( p \)-group (a group of order \( p^n \) for some prime \( p \) and some positive integer \( n \)) has nontrivial center.

-   A consequence of the theorems above: every group of order \( p^2 \) (where \( p \) is prime) is abelian.
:::

::: {.solution}
Since \( Z(G) \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( |G| = p^3 \), by Lagrange's theorem, \( |Z(G)| \in \{1, p, p^2, p^3\} \).

Since we stipulated that \( G \) is nonabelian, \( |Z(G)| \ne p^3 \). Also, since \( G \) is a \( p \)-group, it has nontrivial center, so \( |Z(G)| \ne 1 \). Finally, by the \( G/Z(G) \) theorem, \( |Z(G)| \ne p^2 \): if \( |Z(G)| = p^2 \), then \( |G/Z(G)| = p \) and so \( G/Z(G) \) would be cyclic, meaning that \( G \) is abelian. Hence, \( |Z(G)| = p \).

Then, since \( |Z(G)| = p \), we have that \( |G/Z(G)| = p^2 \), and so \( G/Z(G) \) is abelian. Thus, \( [G, G] \in Z(G) \). Since \( |Z(G)| = p \), then \( |[G,G]| \in \{ 1, p\} \) again by Lagrange's theorem. If \( |[G,G]| = p \) then \( [G,G] = Z(G) \) and we are done. And, indeed, we must have \( |[G,G]| = p \), because \( G \) is nonabelian and so \( |[G,G]| \ne 1 \).

-   By definition, \( S\in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \iff S \) is a *maximal* \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup: \( S<G \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group, so \( \#S = p^k \) for some \( k \), \( S \) is a proper subgroup, and \( S \) is maximal in the sense that there are no proper \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroups \( S' \) with \( S \subseteq S' \subseteq G \).
-   Since \( \# H = p^i \), \( H \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup of \( G \).
-   If \( H \) is maximal, then by definition \( H\in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \)
-   Otherwise, if \( H \) is not maximal, there exists an \( H' \supseteq H \) with \( H'\leq G \) a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup properly containing \( H \).
    -   In this apply the same argument to \( H' \): this yields a proper superset containment at every stage, and since \( G \) is finite, there is no infinite ascending chain of proper supersets.
    -   So this terminates in some maximal \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup \( S \), i.e.Â a Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup.
-   So \( H \subseteq S \) for some \( S\in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \).
-   All Sylows are conjugate, so for any \( S' \in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \) we can write \( S' = gSg^{-1} \) for some \( g \).
-   Then using that \( H \) is normal, \( H \subseteq S \implies H = gHg^{-1}\subseteq gSg^{-1}\coloneqq S' \). So \( H \) is contained in every Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup.

-   Claim: \( Z(H) \leq H \) works.
    -   It is nontrivial since \( H \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group and \( p{\hbox{-}} \)groups have nontrivial centers
    -   It is abelian since \( Z(Z(H)) = Z(H) \).
    -   \( \#Z(H) = p^\ell \) for some \( \ell \leq i \) by Lagrange
-   It thus remains to show that \( Z(H) {~\trianglelefteq~}G \).
-   Use that \( Z(H) \char H \) and use transitivity of characteristic to conclude \( Z(H) {~\trianglelefteq~}H \).
-   That \( Z(H) \char H \): let \( \psi \in {\operatorname{Aut}}(H) \) and \( x=\psi(y)\in \psi(Z(H)) \) so \( y\in Z(H) \), then for arbitrary \( h\in H \),
    \[
     \psi(y)h 
     &= \psi(y) (\psi \circ \psi^{-1})(h) \\
     &= \psi( y \cdot \psi^{-1}(h) ) \\
     &= \psi( \psi^{-1}(h) \cdot y ) && \text{since } \psi^{-1}(h)\in H, \, y\in Z(H) \\
     &= h\psi(y)
     .\]
-   That \( A \char B {~\trianglelefteq~}C \implies A{~\trianglelefteq~}C \):
    -   \( A\char B \) iff \( A \) is fixed by every \( \psi\in {\operatorname{Aut}}(B) \)., WTS \( cAc^{-1}= A \) for all \( c\in C \).
    -   Since \( B{~\trianglelefteq~}C \), the automorphism \( \psi({-}) \coloneqq c({-})c^{-1} \) descends to an element of \( {\operatorname{Aut}}(B) \).
    -   Then \( \psi(A) = A \) since \( A\char B \), so \( cAc^{-1}= A \) and \( A{~\trianglelefteq~}C \).

-   Suppose \( G = \left\langle{ a, b}\right\rangle \) with \( a^2 = b^2 = e \), satisfying some unknown relations.

-   Consider \( ab \). Since \( G \) is finite, this has finite order, so \( (ab)^n = e \) for some \( n\geq 2 \).

-   Note \( \left\langle{ab, b}\right\rangle \subseteq \left\langle{a, b}\right\rangle \), since any finite word in \( ab, b \) is also a finite word in \( a, b \).

-   Since \( (ab)b = ab^2 = a \), we have \( \left\langle{ab, b}\right\rangle \subseteq \left\langle{a, b}\right\rangle \), so \( \left\langle{ab, b}\right\rangle = \left\langle{a, b}\right\rangle \).

-   Write \( D_{2n} = F(r, s) / \ker \pi \) for \( \pi: F(r, s)\to D_{2n} \) the canonical presentation map.

-   Define
    \[
    \psi: F(r, s) &\to G \\
    r &\mapsto ab \\
    t &\mapsto b
    .\]

-   This is clearly surjective since it hits all generators.

-   We'll show that \( ab, a \) satisfy all of the relations defining \( D_{2n} \), which factors \( \psi \) through \( \ker \pi \), yielding a surjection \( \tilde \psi: D_{2n} \twoheadrightarrow G \).

    -   \( (ab)^n = e \) by construction, \( b^2 = e \) by assumption, and
        \[
        b (ab) b^{-1}= babb^{-1}= ba = b^{-1}a^{-1}= (ab)^{-1}
        ,\]
        corresponding to the relation \( srs^{-1}= r^{-1} \). Here we've used that \( o(a) = o(b) = 2 \) implies \( a=a^{-1}, b=b^{-1} \).

-   Surjectivity of \( \tilde \psi \) yields \( 2n = \# D_{2n} \geq \# G \).

-   The claim is that \( \# G \geq 2n \), which forces \( \# G = 2n \). Then \( \tilde \psi \) will be a surjective group morphism between groups of the same order, and thus an isomorphism.

    -   We have \( \left\langle{ ab }\right\rangle\leq G \), so \( n\bigm|\# G \).
    -   Since \( b\not\in \left\langle{ ab }\right\rangle \), this forces \( \# G > n \), so \( \# G \geq 2n \).

-   **Case 1:** \( :p>q \).

-   If \( p>q \), then \( p\geq q+2 \) since \( p+1 \) can't be prime.

-   So \( q \) is not congruent to \( 1\pmod p \), forcing \( n_p = 1 \).

-   **Case 2:**: \( p< q \):

-   For the same reasons as above, \( p\not\equiv 1\pmod q \) forces \( n_q\neq p \).

-   If \( n_q = 1 \), we're done.

-   If \( n_q = p^2 \):

    &\implies g \in \cup_{h\in G} Z(g_j)^h \quad\text{for every } j\\
    &\implies G \subseteq \cup_{h\in G} Z(g_j)^h \quad\text{for every } j
    ,\]

    which by Theorem 3, if \( Z(g_j) < G \) were proper, then the RHS is properly contained in \( G \).

-   So it must be the case that that \( Z(g_j) \) is not proper and thus equal to \( G \) for every \( j \).

-   But \( Z(g_i) = G \iff g_i \in Z(G) \), and so each conjugacy class is size one.

-   So for every \( g\in G \), we have \( g = g_j \) for some \( j \), and thus \( g = g_j \in Z(g_j) = Z(G) \), so \( g \) is central.

-   Then \( G\subseteq Z(G) \) and \( G \) is abelian.

-   We want to show \( Q, R{~\trianglelefteq~}G \), so we proceed by showing \( \textbf{not }\qty{n_5 = 21 \text{ or } n_7 = 15} \), which is equivalent to \( \qty{n_5 = 1 \text{ and } n_7 = 1} \) by the previous restrictions.

-   Note that we can write
    \[
    G = \left\{{\text{elements of order } n}\right\} {\textstyle\coprod}\left\{{\text{elements of order not } n}\right\}
    .\]
    for any \( n \), so we count for \( n=5, 7 \):

    -   Elements in \( QR \) of order **not** equal to 5: \( {\left\lvert {QR - Q\left\{{\operatorname{id}}\right\} + \left\{{\operatorname{id}}\right\}} \right\rvert} = 35 - 5 + 1 = 31 \)
    -   Elements in \( QR \) of order **not** equal to 7: \( {\left\lvert {QR - \left\{{\operatorname{id}}\right\}R + \left\{{\operatorname{id}}\right\}} \right\rvert} = 35 - 7 + 1 = 29 \)

-   Since \( QR \leq G \), we have

    -   Elements in \( G \) of order **not** equal to 5 \( \geq 31 \).
    -   Elements in \( G \) of order **not** equal to 7 \( \geq 29 \).

-   \( P\cap QR = \left\{{e}\right\} \) since \( (3, 35) = 1 \)

We also have \( PQR = G \) since \( {\left\lvert {PQR} \right\rvert} = {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} \) (???).

We thus have an internal direct product

G \cong P\times Q \times R \cong {\mathbb{Z}}_3 \times{\mathbb{Z}}_5 \times{\mathbb{Z}}_7 \cong {\mathbb{Z}}_{105}

-   We will show that \( x\in J(R) \implies 1+x \in R^{\times} \), from which the result follows by letting \( x=rx \).

-   Let \( x\in J(R) \), so it is in every maximal ideal, and suppose toward a contradiction that \( 1+x \) is **not** a unit.

-   Then consider \( I = \left\langle{1+x}\right\rangle {~\trianglelefteq~}R \). Since \( 1+x \) is not a unit, we can't write \( s(1+x) = 1 \) for any \( s\in R \), and so \( 1 \not\in I \) and \( I\neq R \)

-   So \( I < R \) is proper and thus contained in some maximal proper ideal \( \mathfrak{m} < R \) by part (1), and so we have \( 1+x \in \mathfrak{m} \). Since \( x\in J(R) \), \( x\in \mathfrak{m} \) as well.

-   Consider
    \[
    M' \coloneqq\left\{{rx + m {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}r\in R,~ m\in M}\right\}
    .\]

-   Since \( \mathfrak{m} \) was maximal, \( \mathfrak{m} \subsetneq M' \) and so \( M' = R \).

-   So every element in \( R \) can be written as \( rx + m \) for some \( r\in R, m\in M \). But \( 1\in R \), so we have
    \[
    1 = rx + m
    .\]

-   So let \( s = -r \) and write \( 1 = sx - m \), and so \( m = 1 + sx \).

-   Since \( s\in R \) by assumption \( 1+sx \) is a unit and thus \( m \in \mathfrak{m} \) is a unit, a contradiction.

-   Let \( x \in J(R) \setminus \mathfrak N(R) \).

-   Without loss of generality, we can suppose \( x^2 = x \) by replacing \( x^m \) with \( x^{2m} \).

-   If \( 1-x \) is not a unit, then \( \left\langle{1-x}\right\rangle \) is a nontrivial proper ideal, which by (a) is contained in some maximal ideal \( {\mathfrak{m}} \). But then \( x\in {\mathfrak{m}} \) and \( 1-x \in {\mathfrak{m}}\implies x + (1-x) = 1 \in {\mathfrak{m}} \), a contradiction.

-   So \( 1-x \) is a unit, so let \( u = (1-x)^{-1} \).

-   Then

-   We identify \( \ker \phi = \left\{{x\in R {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}rx = 0}\right\} \), and since \( r\neq 0 \) by assumption, this implies each such \( x \) is a zero divisor by definition (and \( \ker \phi \) is nonempty by assumption).

-   Similarly, we identify \( \operatorname{im}\phi = \left\{{y = rx {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}x\in R}\right\} \). So let \( y\in \operatorname{im}\phi \).

-   Let \( \phi_i \) be the \( n \) maps \( x \mapsto z_i x \), and let \( K_i = \ker \phi_i \) be the corresponding kernels.

-   Fix an \( i \).

    {\left\lvert {K_i} \right\rvert} \leq n < \infty \quad \text{for each } i

-   Now consider \( R/K_i \coloneqq\left\{{r + K_i}\right\} \).

-   By the first isomorphism theorem, \( R/K_i \cong \operatorname{im}\phi \), and by (b) every element in the image is a zero divisor, so

    [R: K_i] = {\left\lvert {R/K_i} \right\rvert} = {\left\lvert {\operatorname{im}\phi_i} \right\rvert} \leq n

    \[

-   By (c), if there are exactly 2 zero divisors then \( {\left\lvert {R} \right\rvert} \leq 4 \). Since every element in a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor, and \( {\left\lvert {R^{\times}} \right\rvert} \geq 2 \) since \( \pm 1 \) are always units, we must have \( {\left\lvert {R} \right\rvert} = 4 \).

-   Since the characteristic of a ring must divide its size, we have \( \operatorname{ch}R = 2 \) or \( 4 \).

-   Using the hint, we see that only \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \) has characteristic 4, which has exactly 2 zero divisors given by \( [0]_4 \) and \( [2]_4 \).

-   If \( R \) has characteristic 2, we can check the other 3 possibilities.

-   We can write \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)[t]/(t^2) = \left\{{a + bt {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}a,b\in {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)}\right\} \), and checking the multiplication table we have
    \[
    \begin{array}{c|cccc}
              & 0 & 1     & t & 1+t   \\ \hline
    0       & 0 & 0     & 0 & 0     \\ 
    1       & 0 & 1     & t & 1+t   \\ 
    t       & 0 & t     & \mathbf{0} & t    \\ 
    1 + t & 0 & 1+t & t & 1     \\ 
    \end{array}
    ,\]

    and so we find that \( t, 0 \) are the zero divisors.

-   In \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)[t]/(t^2 - t) \), we can check that \( t^2 = t \implies t t^2 = t^2 \implies t(t^2 + 1) = 0 \implies t(t+1) = 0 \), so both \( t \) and \( t+1 \) are zero divisors, along with zero, so this is not a possibility.

-   Similarly, in \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)[t]/(t^2 + t + 1) \), we can check the bottom-right corner of the multiplication table to find
    \[
    \left[\begin{array}{c|cc}
      & t     & 1 +t \\ \hline
    t & 1+t & 1 \\
    t & 1   & t \\
    \end{array}\right]
    ,\]

    and so this ring only has one zero divisor.

-   Thus the only possibilities are:
    \[
    R &\cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \\
    R &\cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)[t] / (t^2)

Let \( K = {\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta) \). Then \( K \) is the splitting field of \( f(x) = x^n - 1 \), which is irreducible over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \), so \( K/{\mathbb{Q}} \) is normal. We also have \( f'(x) = nx^{n-1} \) and \( \gcd(f, f') = 1 \) since they can not share any roots.

> Or equivalently, \( f \) splits into distinct linear factors \( f(x) = \prod_{k\leq n}(x-\zeta^k) \).

Since it is a Galois extension, \( {\left\lvert {\operatorname{Gal}(K/{\mathbb{Q}})} \right\rvert} = [K: {\mathbb{Q}}] = \phi(n) \) for the totient function.

We can now define maps
\[
\tau_j: K &\to K \\
\zeta &\mapsto \zeta^j 
\]
and if we restrict to \( j \) such that \( \gcd(n, j) = 1 \), this yields \( \phi(n) \) maps. Noting that if \( \zeta \) is a primitive root, then \( (n, j) = 1 \) implies that that \( \zeta^j \) is also a primitive root, and hence another root of \( \min(\zeta, {\mathbb{Q}}) \), and so these are in fact automorphisms of \( K \) that fix \( {\mathbb{Q}} \) and thus elements of \( \operatorname{Gal}(K/{\mathbb{Q}}) \).

So define a map
\[
\theta: {\mathbb{Z}}_n^{\times}&\to K \\
[j]_n &\mapsto \tau_j

The claim is that this is a surjective homomorphism, and since both groups are the same size, an isomorphism.

Letting \( \sigma \in K \) be arbitrary, noting that \( [K: {\mathbb{Q}}] \) has a basis \( \left\{{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}}\right\} \), it suffices to specify \( \sigma(\zeta) \) to fully determine the automorphism. (Since \( \sigma(\zeta^k) = \sigma(\zeta)^k \).)

In particular, \( \sigma(\zeta) \) satisfies the polynomial \( x^n - 1 \), since \( \sigma(\zeta)^n = \sigma(\zeta^n) = \sigma(1) = 1 \), which means \( \sigma(\zeta) \) is another root of unity and \( \sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^k \) for some \( 1\leq k \leq n \).

Moreover, since \( o(\zeta) = n \in K^{\times} \), we must have \( o(\zeta^k) = n \in K^{\times} \) as well. Noting that \( \left\{{\zeta^i}\right\} \) forms a cyclic subgroup \( H\leq K^{\times} \), then \( o(\zeta^k) = n \iff (n, k) = 1 \) (by general theory of cyclic groups).

Thus \( \theta \) is surjective.

[K: {\mathbb{Q}}] = [K: L] [L : {\mathbb{Q}}] = (2)(2) = 4
.\]

This \( {\left\lvert {\operatorname{Gal}(K/{\mathbb{Q}})} \right\rvert} = 4 \), which leaves only two possibilities:

-   \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2) \times{\mathbb{Z}}/(2) \)
-   \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \)

We can next check orders of elements. Take
\[
\sigma &\in \operatorname{Gal}(K/{\mathbb{Q}}) \\
\alpha_1 &\mapsto \alpha_2
.\]

Computations show that

-   \( \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2^2 = 2 \), so \( \alpha_1 \alpha_2 = \sqrt 2 \)
-   \( \alpha_1^2 = 2 + \sqrt 2 \implies \sqrt 2 = \alpha_1^2 - 2 \)

and thus
\[
\sigma^2(\alpha_1) &= \sigma(\alpha_2) \\
&= \sigma\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\alpha_1}\right) \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\sqrt 2)}{\sigma(\alpha_1)} \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\alpha_1^2 - 2)}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \frac{\alpha_2^2 - 2}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -2\alpha_2^{-1}\\
&= \alpha_2 - \frac{2\alpha_1}{\sqrt 2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -\alpha_1 \sqrt 2 \\
&\neq \alpha_1
,\]

and so the order of \( \sigma \) is strictly greater than 2, and thus 4, and thus \( \operatorname{Gal}(K/{\mathbb{Q}}) = \left\{{\sigma^k {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}1\leq k \leq 4}\right\} \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \).

Let \( K \) be a Galois extension of \( {\mathbb{Q}} \) with Galois group \( G \), and let \( E_1 , E_2 \) be intermediate fields of \( K \) which are the splitting fields of irreducible \( f_i (x) \in {\mathbb{Q}}[x] \).

Let \( E = E_1 E_2 \subset K \).

Let \( H_i = \operatorname{Gal}(K/E_i) \) and \( H = \operatorname{Gal}(K/E) \).

a.  Show that \( H = H_1 \cap H_2 \).

::: {.proof title="of a"}
By the Galois correspondence, it suffices to show that the fixed field of \( H_1 \cap H_2 \) is \( E_1 E_2 \).

Let \( \sigma \in H_1 \cap H_2 \); then \( \sigma \in {\operatorname{Aut}}(K) \) fixes both \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \).

> Not sure if this works -- compositum is not literally product..?

Writing \( x \in E_1E_2 \) as \( x=e_1 e_2 \), we have
\[
\sigma(x) = \sigma(e_1 e_2) = \sigma(e_1) \sigma(e_2) = e_1 e_2  =x,
\]

so \( \sigma \) fixes \( E_1 E_2 \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of b"}
That \( H_1 H_2 \subseteq G \) is clear, since if \( \sigma = \tau_1 \tau_2 \in H_1 H_2 \), then each \( \tau_i \) is an automorphism of \( K \) that fixes \( E_i \supseteq {\mathbb{Q}} \), so each \( \tau_i \) fixes \( {\mathbb{Q}} \) and thus \( \sigma \) fixes \( {\mathbb{Q}} \).

-   Let \( \sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \in H_1 H_2 \).

-   Note that \( \sigma_1(e) = e \) for all \( e\in E_1 \) by definition, since \( H_1 \) fixes \( E_1 \), and \( \sigma_2(e) \in E_1 \) (?).

-   Then
    \[
    \sigma_1(e) = e \quad \forall e \in E_1 \implies \sigma_1(\sigma_2(e)) = \sigma_2(e) 
    \]
    and substituting \( e = \sigma_1(e) \) on the RHS yields
    \[
    \sigma_1 \sigma_2(e) = \sigma_2 \sigma_1(e)
    ,\]
    where a similar proof holds for \( e\in E_2 \) and thus for arbitrary \( x\in E_1 E_2 \).
:::
:::

::: {.proof title="of c"}
By the Galois correspondence, the subgroup \( H_1H_2 \leq G \) will correspond to an intermediate field \( E \) such that \( K/E/{\mathbb{Q}} \) and \( E \) is the fixed field of \( H_1 H_2 \).

But if \( \sigma \in H_1 H_2 \), then \( \sigma = \tau_1 \tau_2 \) where \( \tau_i \) is an automorphism of \( K \) that fixes \( E_i \), and so
\[
\sigma(x) = x \iff \tau_1\tau_2(x) = x
&\iff \tau_2(x) = x 
\\
&~\&~ 
\\
\tau_1(x) = x &\iff x \in E_1 \cap E_2

Let \( R \) be a commutative ring, and let \( M \) be an \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module. An \( R{\hbox{-}} \)submodule \( N \) of \( M \) is maximal if there is no \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module \( P \) with \( N \subsetneq P \subsetneq M \).

a.  Show that an \( R{\hbox{-}} \)submodule \( N \) of \( M \) is maximal \( \iff M /N \) is a simple \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module: i.e., \( M /N \) is nonzero and has no proper, nonzero \( R{\hbox{-}} \)submodules.

b.  Let \( M \) be a \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)module. Show that a \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)submodule \( N \) of \( M \) is maximal \( \iff \#M /N \) is a prime number.

c.  Let \( M \) be the \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)module of all roots of unity in \( {\mathbb{C}} \) under multiplication. Show that there is no maximal \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)submodule of \( M \).

By the correspondence theorem, submodules of \( M/N \) biject with submodules \( A \) of \( M \) containing \( N \).

So

-   \( M \) is maximal:

-   \( \iff \) no such (proper, nontrivial) submodule \( A \) exists

-   \( \iff \) there are no (proper, nontrivial) submodules of \( M/N \)

-   \( \iff M/N \) is simple.
:::

::: {.proof title="of b"}
Identify \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)modules with abelian groups, then by (a), \( N \) is maximal \( \iff \) \( M/N \) is simple \( \iff \) \( M/N \) has no nontrivial proper subgroups.\

By Cauchy's theorem, if \( {\left\lvert {M/N} \right\rvert} = ab \) is a composite number, then \( a\bigm|ab \implies \) there is an element (and thus a subgroup) of order \( a \). In this case, \( M/N \) contains a nontrivial proper cyclic subgroup, so \( M/N \) is not simple. So \( {\left\lvert {M/N} \right\rvert} \) can not be composite, and therefore must be prime.

Let \( G = \left\{{x \in {\mathbb{C}}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}x^n=1 \text{ for some }n\in {\mathbb{N}}}\right\} \), and suppose \( H < G \) is a proper subgroup.

Then there must be a prime \( p \) such that the \( \zeta_{p^k} \not \in H \) for all \( k \) greater than some constant \( m \) -- otherwise, we can use the fact that if \( \zeta_{p^k} \in H \) then \( \zeta_{p^\ell} \in H \) for all \( \ell \leq k \), and if \( \zeta_{p^k} \in H \) for all \( p \) and all \( k \) then \( H = G \).

But this means there are infinitely many elements in \( G\setminus H \), and so \( \infty = [G: H] = {\left\lvert {G/H} \right\rvert} \) is not a prime. Thus by (b), \( H \) can not be maximal, a contradiction.

-   \( A \) is diagonalizable iff \( \min_A(x) \) is separable.
    -   See [further discussion here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3027664/if-a-is-invertible-and-an-is-diagonalizable-then-a-is-diagonalizable).

::: {.claim}
If \( A \in \operatorname{GL}(m, {\mathbb{F}}) \) is invertible and \( A^n/{\mathbb{F}} \) is diagonalizable, then \( A/{\mathbb{F}} \) is diagonalizable.
:::

::: {.proof title="of claim"}
-   Let \( A \in \operatorname{GL}(m, {\mathbb{F}}) \).

-   Since \( A^n \) is diagonalizable, \( \min_{A^n}(x) \in {\mathbb{F}}[x] \) is separable and thus factors as a product of \( m \) **distinct** linear factors:
    \[
    \min_{A^n}(x) = \prod_{i=1}^m (x-\lambda_i), \quad \min_{A^n}(A^n) = 0
    \]

    where \( \left\{{\lambda_i}\right\}_{i=1}^m \subset {\mathbb{F}} \) are the **distinct** eigenvalues of \( A^n \).

-   Moreover \( A\in \operatorname{GL}(m,{\mathbb{F}}) \implies A^n \in \operatorname{GL}(m,{\mathbb{F}}) \): \( A \) is invertible \( \iff \det(A) = d \in {\mathbb{F}}^{\times} \), and so \( \det(A^n) = \det(A)^n = d^n \in {\mathbb{F}}^{\times} \) using the fact that the determinant is a ring morphism \( \det: \operatorname{Mat}(m\times m) \to{\mathbb{F}} \) and \( {\mathbb{F}}^{\times} \) is closed under multiplication.

-   So \( A^n \) is invertible, and thus has trivial kernel, and thus zero is not an eigenvalue, so \( \lambda_i \neq 0 \) for any \( i \).

-   Since the \( \lambda_i \) are distinct and nonzero, this implies \( x^k \) is not a factor of \( \mu_{A^n}(x) \) for any \( k\geq 0 \). Thus the \( m \) terms in the product correspond to precisely \( m \) **distinct linear** factors.

-   We can now construct a polynomial that annihilates \( A \), namely
    \[
    q_A(x) \coloneqq\min_{A^n}(x^n) = \prod_{i=1}^m (x^n-\lambda_i) \in {\mathbb{F}}[x],
    \]

    where we can note that \( q_A(A) = \min_{A^n}(A^n) = 0 \), and so \( \min_A(x) \bigm|q_A(x) \) by minimality.

::: {.claim}
\( q_A(x) \) has exactly \( nm \) distinct linear factors in \( { \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu \mathbb{F}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu }[x] \)
:::

-   This reduces to showing that no pair \( x^n-\lambda_i, x^n-\lambda_j \) share a root. and that \( x^n-\lambda_i \) does not have multiple roots.

-   For the first claim, we can factor
    \[
    x^n - \lambda_i = \prod_{k=1}^n (x - \lambda_i^{1\over n} e^{2\pi i k \over n}) \coloneqq\prod_{k=1}^n (x-\lambda^{1\over n} \zeta_n^k)
    ,\]
    where we now use the fact that \( i\neq j \implies \lambda_i^{1\over n} \neq \lambda_j^{1\over n} \). Thus no term in the above product appears as a factor in \( x^n - \lambda_j \) for \( j\neq i \).

-   For the second claim, we can check that \( {\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\,}\qty{x^n - \lambda_i} = nx^{n-1}\neq 0\in {\mathbb{F}} \), and \( \gcd(x^n-\lambda_i, nx^{n-1}) = 1 \) since the latter term has only the roots \( x=0 \) with multiplicity \( n-1 \), whereas \( \lambda_i\neq 0 \implies \) zero is not a root of \( x^n-\lambda_i \).

But now since \( q_A(x) \) has exactly distinct linear factors in \( \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\mathbb{F}}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu[x] \) and \( \min_A(x) \bigm|q_A(x) \), \( \min_A(x) \in {\mathbb{F}}[x] \) can only have distinct linear factors, and \( A \) is thus diagonalizable over \( {\mathbb{F}} \).

So \( V \) is a cyclic \( k[x] \) module, which means that \( V = k[x]\curvearrowright\mathbf{v} \) for some \( \mathbf{v}\in V \) such that \( \operatorname{Ann}(\mathbf{v}) = \chi_A(x) \), i.e.Â there is some element \( \mathbf{v}\in V \) whose orbit is all of \( V \).

But then noting that monomials span \( k[x] \) as a \( k{\hbox{-}} \)module, we can write
\[
V &\cong
k[x] \curvearrowright\mathbf{v} \\
&\coloneqq\left\{{f(x) \curvearrowright\mathbf{v} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}f \in k[x]}\right\} \\
&= {\operatorname{span}}_k \left\{{x^k \curvearrowright\mathbf{v} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}k \geq 0}\right\} \\
&\coloneqq{\operatorname{span}}_k \left\{{A^k\mathbf{v} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}k \geq 0}\right\}
.\]

Moreover, we can note that if \( \ell \geq \deg \chi_A(x) \), then \( A^\ell \) is a linear combination of \( \left\{{A^j \mathrel{\Big|}0 \leq j \leq n-1}\right\} \), and so
\[
V &\cong {\operatorname{span}}_k \left\{{A^\ell\mathbf{v} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\ell \geq 0}\right\} \\
&= {\operatorname{span}}_k \left\{{A^\ell \mathbf{v} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}1 \leq \ell \leq n-1}\right\}

    -   Note that since \( W<V \) is proper, \( j\geq 1 \).

-   Restrict \( T \) to \( W \) to get \( T_W \), then let \( B = [T_W]_{{\mathcal{B}}_W} \) be the matrix representation of \( T_W \) with respect to \( {\mathcal{B}}_W \).

-   Now consider the matrix representation \( [T]_{{\mathcal{B}}_V} \), in block form this is given by
    \[
    [T]_{{\mathcal{B}}_V} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    B & C \\
    0 & D

    \chi_{T, V}(x) \coloneqq\det([T]_{{\mathcal{B}}_V} - xI) = \det(B - xI)\cdot \det(D - xI) \coloneqq\chi_{T, W}(x) \cdot \det(D-xI)

-   Claim: \( \det(D - xI) \in xF[x] \) is nontrivial

-   The claim follows because this forces \( \deg(\det(D-xI)) \geq 1 \) and so \( \chi_{T, W}(x) \) is a proper divisor of \( \chi_{T, V}(x) \).

-   Since \( \chi_{T, F} \) is irreducible, these polynomials are equal.
-   Claim: \( T/F \) is diagonalizable \( \iff \min_{T, F} \) splits over \( F \) and is squarefree.
-   Replace \( F \) with its algebraic closure, then \( \min_{T, F} \) splits.
-   Claim: in characteristic zero, every irreducible polynomial is separable
    -   Proof: it must be the case that either \( \gcd(f, f') = 1 \) or \( f' \equiv 0 \), where the second case only happens in characteristic \( p>0 \).
    -   The first case is true because \( \deg f' < \deg f \), and if \( \gcd(f, f') = p \), then \( \deg p < \deg f \) and \( p\bigm|f \) forces \( p=1 \) since \( f \) is irreducible.

    so we will find the eigenvalues of \( B \) and subtract one from each.

-   Note that \( B\mathbf{v} = {\left[ {\sum v_i, \sum v_i, \cdots, \sum v_i} \right]} \), i.e.Â it has the effect of summing all of the entries of \( \mathbf{v} \) and placing that sum in each component.

-   So every \( \mathbf{p}_i \in \ker(B) \), so they are eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0.
-   Since the first component is fixed and we have \( p-1 \) choices for where to place a \( -1 \), this yields \( p-1 \) possibilities for \( \mathbf{p}_i \)

    thus \( \lambda_1 = p \)
-   \( \dim E_{\lambda_1} = 1 \) since the eigenspaces are orthogonal and \( E_{\lambda_0} \oplus E_{\lambda_1} \leq F^p \) is a subspace, so \( p > \dim(E_{\lambda_0}) + \dim E_{\lambda_1} = p-1 + \dim E_{\lambda_1} \) and it isn't zero dimensional.

-   Can check that \( \det(A) = \pm 1 \in {\mathbb{F}}_p^{\times} \), so the vectors \( \mathbf{e}_1 - \mathbf{e}_i \) are still linearly independent and thus \( \dim E_{-1} = p-1 \)
    -   So there are \( p-1 \) Jordan blocks for \( \lambda = 0 \).

Summary:
\[
\min_{A, {\mathbb{F}}_p}(x) &= (x+1)^2 \\
\chi_{A, {\mathbb{F}}_p}(x) &\equiv (x+1)^p \\
\dim E_{-1} &= p-1
.\]

Thus
\[
JCF_{{\mathbb{F}}_p}(A)
=  J_{-1}^{2} \oplus (p-2)J_{-1}^1
= \left[\begin{array}{rr|r|r|r|r}
-1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0& -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0& 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & -1 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\]

To obtain a basis for \( E_{\lambda = 0} \), first note that the matrix \( P = [\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{p}_1, \cdots , \mathbf{p}_{p-1}] \) from part (a) is singular over \( {\mathbb{F}}_p \), since
\[
\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{p}_1 + \mathbf{p}_2 + \cdots + \mathbf{p}_{p-2}
&= [p-1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0, 1] \\
&= [-1, 0,0,\cdots, 0, 1] \\
&= - \mathbf{p}_{p-1}
.\]

We still have a linearly independent set given by the first \( p-1 \) columns of \( P \), so we can extend this to a basis by finding one linearly independent generalized eigenvector.

Solving \( (A-I\lambda)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v}_1 \) is our only option (the others won't yield solutions). This amounts to solving \( B\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v}_1 \), which imposes the condition \( \sum x_i = 1 \), so we can choose \( \mathbf{x} = [1, 0, \cdots, 0] \).

Thus
\[
P = [\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{p}_{p-2}] =
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  \\
1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\]
