### Nonstandard Topics

- Show that $H~\text{char}~G \Rightarrow H \unlhd G$

- Show that if $H \leq G$, $K\normal G$ is a normal subgroup, and $H~\text{char}~K$ then $H$ is normal in  $G$.

  > So normality is not transitive, but strengthening one to "characteristic" gives a weak form of transitivity.
