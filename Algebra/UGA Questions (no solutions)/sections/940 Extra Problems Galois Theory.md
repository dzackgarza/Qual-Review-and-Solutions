## Galois Theory

### Theory
- Show that if $K/F$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial then it is Galois.
- Show that any quadratic extension of a field $F$ with $\ch(F)\neq 2$ is Galois.
- Show that if $K/E/F$ with $K/F$ Galois then $K/E$ is always Galois with $g(K/E) \leq g(K/F)$.
  - Show additionally $E/F$ is Galois $\iff g(K/E) \normal g(K/F)$.
  - Show that in this case, $g(E/F) = g(K/F) / g(K/E)$.
- Show that if $E/k, F/k$ are Galois with $E\intersect F = k$, then $EF/k$ is Galois and $G(EF/k) \cong G(E/k)\times G(F/k)$.

### Computations
- Show that the Galois group of $x^n - 2$ is $D_n$, the dihedral group on $n$ vertices.
- Compute all intermediate field extensions of $\QQ(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3)$, show it is equal to $\QQ(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)$, and find a corresponding minimal polynomial.

- Compute all intermediate field extensions of $\QQ(2^{1\over 4}, \zeta_8)$.
- Show that $\QQ(2^{1\over 3})$ and $\QQ(\zeta_3 2^{1\over 3})$
- Show that if $L/K$ is separable, then $L$ is normal $\iff$ there exists a polynomial $p(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n x- \alpha_i\in K[x]$ such that $L = K(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n)$ (so $L$ is the splitting field of $p$).
- Is $\QQ(2^{1\over 3})/\QQ$ normal? 
- Show that  $\GF(p^n)$ is the splitting field of $x^{p^n} - x \in \FF_p[x]$.
- Show that $\GF(p^d) \leq \GF(p^n) \iff d\divides n$
- Compute the Galois group of $x^n - 1 \in \QQ[x]$ as a function of $n$.
- Identify all of the elements of the Galois group of $x^p-2$ for $p$ an odd prime (note: this has a complicated presentation).
- Show that $\gal(x^{15}+2)/\QQ \cong S_2 \semidirect \ZZ/15\ZZ$ for $S_2$ a Sylow $2\dash$subgroup.
- Show that $\gal(x^3+4x+2)/\QQ \cong S_3$, a symmetric group.
