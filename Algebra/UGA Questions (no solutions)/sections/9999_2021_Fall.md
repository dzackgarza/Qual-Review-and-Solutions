Let $G$ be a group. An automorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G$ is called *inner* if the automorphism is given by conjugation by a fixed group element $g$, i.e.,
\[
\phi=\phi_{g}: h \mapsto g h g^{-1} .
\]

a.
Prove that the set of inner automorphisms forms a normal subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of $G$.

b.
Give an example of a finite group with an automorphism which is not inner.

c.
Denote by $S_{n}$ the group of permutations of the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. Suppose that $g \in S_{n}$ sends $i$ to $g_{i}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n .$ Let $(a, b)$ denote as usual the cycle notation for the transposition which permutes $a$ and $b$. For $i \in\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$, compute $\phi_{g}((i, i+1))$.

d.
Suppose that an automorphism $\phi \in \operatorname{Aut}\left(S_{n}\right)$ preserves cycle type, i.e., that for every element $s$ of $S_{n}, s$ and $\phi(s)$ have the same cycle type. Show that $\phi$ is inner. 

> Hint: Consider the images of generators $\phi((1,2)), \phi((2,3)), \cdots, \phi((n-1, n))$.

- Idea: take a semidirect product involving $C_9$ and $C_7$.
  We'll need some facts: $\Hom(C_m, C_n) \cong C_d$ where $d = \gcd(m, n)$, and $\Aut(C_m)\cong C_m\units$ which has order $\phi(m)$ (since one needs to send generators to generators), which can be explicitly calculated based on the prime factorization of $m$.
  
- Some calculations we'll need:
  - $\Aut(C_9) \cong C_9\units \cong C_{\phi(9)} \cong C_6$, using that $\phi(p^k) = p^{k-1}(p-1)$.
  - $\Aut(C_7) \cong C_7\units \cong C_{\phi(7)}\cong C_6$ using that $\phi(p) = p-1$.
- To get a nonabelian group, we need a nontrivial semidirect product, so look at $\Hom(G, \Aut(H))$ in the two possible combinations.
  - For $\Hom(C_7, \Aut(C_9)) \cong \Hom(C_7, C_6) \cong C_1 \da \ts{e}$ using that $\Hom(C_m, C_n) \cong C_{d}$ for $d = \gcd(m, n)$.

Let $R$ be an algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ which is finite-dimensional as a $\CC\dash$vector space. Recall that an ideal $I$ of $R$ can be considered as a $\CC\dash$subvector space of $R$. We define the codimension of $I$ in $R$ to be 
\[
\codim_R I \da 
\dim_{\CC} R - \dim_{\CC} I
,\] 
the difference between the dimension of $R$ as a $\mathbb{C}\dash$vector space, $\dim_{\CC} R$, and the dimension of $I$ as a $\CC\dash$vector space, $\dim_\CC I$.

a.
Show that any maximal ideal $m \subset R$ has codimension 1 .

b.
Suppose that $\operatorname{dim}_{C} R=2$. Show that there exists a surjective homomorphism of $\CC\dash$algebras from the polynomial ring $\CC[t]$ to $R$.

c.

Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unit and let $M$ be an $R$-module. Define the annihilator of $M$ to be
\[
\operatorname{Ann}(M):=\{r \in R \mid r \cdot m=0 \text { for all } m \in M\}
\]

a.
Prove that $\operatorname{Ann}(M)$ is an ideal in $R$.

b.
Conversely, prove that every ideal in $R$ is the annihilator of some $R$-module.

c.
Give an example of a module $M$ over a ring $R$ such that each element $m \in M$ has a nontrivial annihilator $\operatorname{Ann}(m):=\{r \in R \mid r \cdot m=0\}$, but $\operatorname{Ann}(M)=\{0\}$
