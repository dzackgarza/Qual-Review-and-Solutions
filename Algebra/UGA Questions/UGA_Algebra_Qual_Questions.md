:::{.proof title="Part a"}
Strategy: Burnside.

- Define a sample space $\Omega = G \cross G$, so $\abs{\Omega} = \abs{G}^2$.

- Identify the event we want to analyze: $A \definedas \theset{(g,h) \in G\cross G \suchthat [g,h] = 1}$.
  - Define and note: 
    \[
    A_g \definedas \theset{(g, h) \suchthat h\in H, [g, h] = 1} \implies A = \disjoint_{g\in G} A_g
    .\]

- Set $n$ be the number of conjugacy classes, note we want to show $P(A) = n / \abs{G}$.
 
- Let $G$ act on itself by conjugation, which partitions $G$ into conjugacy classes.

  - What are the orbits? 
    $$
    \mathcal{O}_g = \theset{hgh\inv \suchthat h\in G}
    ,$$ 
    which is the conjugacy class of $g$.

  - What are the fixed points? 
    $$X^g = \theset{h\in G \suchthat hgh\inv = g},$$ 
    which are the elements of $G$ that commute with $g$, which is precisely $A_g$.

- Note $\abs{X/G} = n$, the number of conjugacy classes.

- Note that 
  $$
  \abs{A} = \abs{\disjoint_{g\in G} A_g} = \sum_{g\in G} \abs{A_g} = \sum_{g\in G}\abs{X^g}
  .$$


- Apply Burnside
$$
\abs{X / G} = \frac { 1 } { | G | } \sum _ { g \in G } \left| X ^ { g } \right|,
$$
- Rearrange and use definition:
$$
n \abs{G}
= \abs{X/G} \abs{G}
= \sum _ { g \in G } \left| X ^ { g } \right|
$$
- Compute probability:
\[
P(A)
= {\abs A \over \abs \Omega} 
= \frac{\sum_{ g \in G } \left| X ^ { g } \right|}{\abs{G}^2} 
= \frac{\abs{X/G}\abs{G}}{\abs{G}^2} 
= \frac{n \abs{G}}{\abs{G}^2} 
= \frac n {\abs G}
.\]

:::

:::{.proof title="Part b"}
Statement of the class equation:
\[
\abs G = Z(G) + \sum_{\substack{\text{One $x$ from each} \\ \text{conjugacy class}}}[G: Z(x)]
\]
where $Z(x) = \theset{g\in G \suchthat [g, x] = 1}$.
:::


:::{.proof title="Part c"}
As shown in part 1,
$$
\mathcal{O}_x = \theset{g\actson x \suchthat g\in G} = \theset{h\in G \suchthat ghg\inv = h} = C_G(g)
,$$
and by the class equation

$$
\abs{G} = \abs{Z(G)} + \sum_{\substack{\text{One $x$ from each} \\ \text{conjugacy class}}}[G: Z(x)]
$$

Now note

- Each element of $Z(G)$ is in its own conjugacy class, contributing $\abs{Z(G)}$ classes to $n$.

- Every other class of elements in $G\setminus Z(G)$ contains at least 2 elements
  - Claim: each such class contributes **at least** $\frac 1 2 \abs{G \setminus Z(G)}$.

Thus
\[
n &\leq \abs{Z(G)} + \frac 1 2\abs{G \setminus Z(G)} \\
&= \abs{Z(G)} + \frac 1 2\abs{G} - \frac 1 2 \abs{Z(G)} \\
&= \frac 1 2 \abs{G} + \frac 1 2 \abs{Z(G)} \\
\\
\implies \frac n {\abs G}
&\leq \frac 1 2 \frac{\abs{G}}{\abs{G}}  + \frac 1 2 \frac{\abs{Z(G)}}{\abs{G}} \\
&= \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 2 \frac 1 {[G: Z(G)]}

- Let $G\actson \theset{H \suchthat H \leq G}$ by $H \mapsto gHg\inv$.

- So Orbit-Stabilizer says $\mathcal O_h \cong G/\mathrm{Stab}(H)$; then just take sizes.

:::{.claim title="3"}
$\union_{g\in G} H^g = \union_{g\in G} gHg\inv \subsetneq G$ for any proper $H \leq G$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
- By theorem 2, since each coset is of size $\abs{H}$, which only intersect at the identity, and there are exactly $[G: N_G(H)]$ of them
  \[
  \abs{\union_{g\in G} H^g} 
  &= \qty{ \abs{H} - 1} [G: N_G(H)] + 1\\
  &= \abs{H} [G: N_G(H)]  - [G:N_G(H)] + 1\\
  &= \abs{G} \frac{\abs G}{\abs{N_G(H)}} - \frac{\abs G}{\abs{N_G(H)}} + 1 \\
  &\leq \abs{H} \frac{\abs G}{\abs{H}} - \frac{\abs G}{\abs{H}} + 1 \\
  &= \abs{G} - ([G: H] - 1) \\
  &< \abs{G} 
  ,\]
  where we use the fact that $H \subseteq N_G(H) \implies \abs{H} \leq \abs{N_G(H)} \implies \frac{1}{\abs{N_G(H)}} \leq \frac{1}{\abs{H}}$, and since $H < G$ is proper, $[G:H] \geq 2$.

- Since $[g_i, g_j] = 1$, we have $g_i \in Z(g_j)$ for every $i, j$.

- Then
  \[
  g\in G 
  &\implies g = g_i^h \quad \text{ for some } h \\
  &\implies g \in Z(g_\mathbf{j})^h \quad\text{for every } j \text{ since }g_i \in Z(g_j) ~\forall j \\
  &\implies g \in \union_{h\in G} Z(g_j)^h \quad\text{for every } j\\
  &\implies G \subseteq \union_{h\in G} Z(g_j)^h \quad\text{for every } j
  ,\]

  which by Theorem 3, if $Z(g_j) < G$ were proper, then the RHS is properly contained in $G$. 
- So it must be the case that that $Z(g_j)$ is not proper and thus equal to $G$ for every $j$.

- But $Z(g_i) = G \iff g_i \in Z(G)$, and so each conjugacy class is size one.
- So for every $g\in G$, we have $g = g_j$ for some $j$, and thus $g = g_j \in Z(g_j) = Z(G)$, so $g$ is central.
- Then $G\subseteq Z(G)$ and $G$ is abelian.

\[

By (a), either $Q$ or $R$ is normal.
Thus $QR \leq G$ is a subgroup, and it has order $\abs{Q} \cdot \abs{R} = 5\cdot 7 = 35$.

By the $pqr$ theorem, since $5$ does not divide $7-1=6$, $QR$ is cyclic.

\todo[inline]{Part (b) not finished!}

:::{.proof title="of 3"}
We want to show $Q, R\normal G$, so we proceed by showing $\textbf{not }\qty{n_5 = 21 \text{ or } n_7 = 15}$, which is equivalent to $\qty{n_5 = 1 \text{ and } n_7 = 1}$ by the previous restrictions.

Note that we can write
\[
G = \theset{\text{elements of order } n} \disjoint \theset{\text{elements of order not } n}
.\]
for any $n$, so we count for $n=5, 7$:

- Elements in $QR$ of order **not** equal to 5: $\abs{QR - Q\theset{\id} + \theset{\id}} = 35 - 5 + 1 = 31$
- Elements in $QR$ of order **not** equal to 7: $\abs{QR - \theset{\id}R + \theset{\id}} = 35 - 7 + 1 = 29$

Since $QR \leq G$, we have

- Elements in $G$ of order **not** equal to 5 $\geq 31$.
- Elements in $G$ of order **not** equal to 7 $\geq 29$.

Now both cases lead to contradictions:

- $n_5 = 21$:
\[
\abs{G}  &= \abs{\theset{\text{elements of order } 5} \disjoint \theset{\text{elements of order not } 5}} \\
&\geq n_5(5-1) + 31 = 21(4) + 31 = 115 > 105 = \abs{G}
.\]

- $n_7 = 15$:
\[
\abs{G}  &= \abs{\theset{\text{elements of order } 7} \disjoint \theset{\text{elements of order not } 7}} \\
&\geq n_7(7-1) + 29 = 15(6) + 29 = 119 > 105 = \abs{G}
.\]

:::

:::{.proof title="of 4"}
Suppose $P$ is normal and recall $\abs{P} = 3, \abs{Q} = 5, \abs{R} = 7$.

- $P\intersect QR = \theset{e}$ since $(3, 35) = 1$ 
- $R\intersect PQ = \theset{e}$ since $(5, 21) = 1$ 
- $Q\intersect RP = \theset{e}$ since $(7, 15) = 1$ 

We also have $PQR = G$ since $\abs{PQR} = \abs{G}$ (???).

We thus have an internal direct product 
\[
G \cong P\cross Q \cross R \cong \ZZ_3 \cross \ZZ_5 \cross \ZZ_7 \cong \ZZ_{105}
.\]
by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which is cyclic.

- Fix $x$ and let $y\in G_x$ be another element in the orbit of $x$.
- Then there exists a $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot x = y$, so $x = g\inv \cdot y$
- Then
\[
h \in G\cdot x

Let $G$ act on its subgroups by conjugation, 

- The orbit $G\cdot H$ is the set of all subgroups conjugate to $H$, and

- The stabilizer of $H$ is $G_H = N_G(H)$.

- By orbit-stabilizer,
\[
G\cdot H = [G: G_H] = [G: N_G(H)]
.\]

- Since $\abs H = n$, and all of its conjugate also have order $n$.

- Note that 
\[
H\leq N_G(H) \implies \abs{H} \leq \abs{N_G(H)} \implies {1\over \abs{N_G(H)}} \leq {1\over \abs{H}}

- Now *strictly* bound the size of the union by overcounting their intersections at the identity:
\[
\abs{\Union_{g\in G}gHg\inv} 
&< (\text{Number of Conjugates of } H) \cdot (\text{Size of each conjugate}) \\ 
& \text{strictly overcounts since they intersect in at least the identity} \\

- Let $G\actson X$ transitively where $\abs{X} \geq 2$
- An action is transitive iff there is only one orbit, so $\abs{X/G} = 1$.
- Apply Burnside's Lemma
\[
1 = \abs{X/G} = \frac{1}{\abs G} \sum_{g\in G} \abs{X^g} \implies \abs{G} = \sum_{g\in G} \abs{X^g}

- Note that $X^e = X$, since the identity must fix every element, so $\abs{X^e} \geq 2$.
- Not *every* other term in the sum can be greater than 1, otherwise the RHS is greater than the size of $G$
- Thus we must have $\abs{X^g} = 0$ for some $g\in G$, i.e. $g$ has no fixed points in $X$.

Strategy: get $p$ to divide $\abs{Z(G)}$.

- Apply the class equation:
\[
\abs{G} = \abs{Z(G)} + \sum [G: C_G(x_i)]
.\]

- Since $C_G(x_i) \leq G$ and $\abs{G} = p^k$, by Lagrange $\abs{C_G(x_i)} = p^\ell$ for some $0\leq \ell \leq k$.
- Since $\abs{G} = p^k$ for some $k$ and $Z(G), C_G(x_i) \leq G$ are subgroups, their orders are powers of $p$.
- Use $$[G: C_G(x_i)] = 1 \iff C_G(x_i) = G \iff \theset{g\in G\suchthat gx_ig\inv = x_i} = G \iff x_i \in Z(G).$$
  - Thus every index appearing in the sum is greater than 1, and thus equal to $p^{\ell_i}$ for some $1\leq \ell_i \leq k$
  - So $p$ divides every term in the sum

- Rearrange 
\[
\abs{G} -  \sum [G: C_G(x_i)]
= \abs{Z(G)} 
.\]

- $p$ divides both terms on the LHS, so must divide the RHS, so $\abs{Z(G)} \geq p$.

$\implies$:

- Then consider $I = \generators{1+x} \normal R$. 
Since $1+x$ is not a unit, we can't write $s(1+x) = 1$ for any $s\in R$, and so $1 \not\in I$ and $I\neq R$

- So $I < R$ is proper and thus contained in some maximal proper ideal $\mathfrak{m} < R$ by part (1), and so we have $1+x \in \mathfrak{m}$.
Since $x\in J(R)$, $x\in \mathfrak{m}$ as well.

- Consider 
\[
M' \definedas \theset{rx + m \suchthat r\in R,~ m\in M}

- Since $\mathfrak{m}$ was maximal, $\mathfrak{m} \subsetneq M'$ and so $M' = R$.

- So every element in $R$ can be written as $rx + m$ for some $r\in R, m\in M$.
But $1\in R$, so we have 
\[
1 = rx + m
.\] 

- So let $s = -r$ and write $1 = sx - m$, and so $m = 1 + sx$.

- Since $s\in R$ by assumption $1+sx$ is a unit and thus $m \in \mathfrak{m}$ is a unit, a contradiction.

- So $x\in \mathfrak{m}$ for every $\mathfrak{m}$ and thus $x\in J(R)$.

:::

:::{.proof title="of c"}
- We want to show $J(R) = \mathfrak N(R)$.

$\mathfrak N(R) \subseteq J(R)$:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-x)^k = \frac{1 - (-x)^n}{1- (-x)} = (1+x)\inv
.$$

- $J(R) \subseteq \mathfrak N(R)$:

- Let $x \in J(R) \setminus \mathfrak N(R)$.

- Since $R$ is finite, $x^m = x$ for some $m > 0$.

- Without loss of generality, we can suppose $x^2 = x$ by replacing $x^m$ with $x^{2m}$.

- If $1-x$ is not a unit, then $\generators{1-x}$ is a nontrivial proper ideal, which by (a) is contained in some maximal ideal $\mm$. 
But then $x\in \mm$ and $1-x \in \mm \implies x + (1-x) = 1 \in \mm$, a contradiction.

Since every element in a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor, and $\abs{R\units} \geq 2$ since $\pm 1$ are always units, we must have $\abs{R} = 4$.

- We can write $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2) = \theset{a + bt \suchthat a,b\in \ZZ/(2)}$, and checking the multiplication table we have
\[
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
			& 0 & 1 	& t & 1+t 	\\ \hline
0 		& 0 & 0 	& 0 & 0   	\\ 
1 		& 0 & 1 	& t & 1+t 	\\ 
t 		& 0 & t 	& \mathbf{0} & t   	\\ 
1 + t & 0 & 1+t & t & 1   	\\ 
\end{array}
,\]

  and so we find that $t, 0$ are the zero divisors.

- In $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2 - t)$, we can check that $t^2 = t \implies t t^2 = t^2 \implies t(t^2 + 1) = 0 \implies t(t+1) = 0$, so both $t$ and $t+1$ are zero divisors, along with zero, so this is not a possibility.

- Similarly, in $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2 + t + 1)$, we can check the bottom-right corner of the multiplication table to find
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c|cc}
	& t 	& 1 +t \\ \hline
t & 1+t & 1 \\
t & 1 	& t \\
\end{array}\right]
,\]

  and so this ring only has one zero divisor.

- Thus the only possibilities are:
\[
R &\cong \ZZ/(4) \\
R &\cong \ZZ/(2)[t] / (t^2)
.\]

- Since $m\divides k \iff k = \ell m$, (**claim**) there is an intermediate subfield $M$ such that
\[
E \leq M \leq F \quad k = [F:E] = [F:M] [M:E] = \ell m
,\]

  so $M$ is a degree $m$ extension of $E$.

- Now consider $M\units$. 
- By the argument in (a), $n$ divides $q^m - 1 = \abs{M\units}$, and $M\units$ is cyclic, so it contains a cyclic subgroup $H$ of order $n$.

- But then $x\in H \implies p(x)\definedas x^n-1 = 0$, and since $p(x)$ has at most $n$ roots in a field. 

- So $H = \theset{x \in M \suchthat x^n-1 = 0}$, i.e. $H$ contains all solutions to $x^n-1$ in $E[x]$.

- But $\zeta$ is one such solution, so $\zeta \in H \subset M\units \subset M$.

- Since $F[\zeta]$ is the smallest field extension containing $\zeta$, we must have $F = M$, so $\ell = 1$, and $k = m$.

Let $K = \QQ(\zeta)$. 
Then $K$ is the splitting field of $f(x) = x^n - 1$, which is irreducible over $\QQ$, so $K/\QQ$ is normal.
We also have $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ and $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ since they can not share any roots.

> Or equivalently, $f$ splits into distinct linear factors $f(x) = \prod_{k\leq n}(x-\zeta^k)$.

Since it is a Galois extension, $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = [K: \QQ] = \phi(n)$ for the totient function.

We can now define maps
\[
\tau_j: K &\to K \\
\zeta &\mapsto \zeta^j 
\]
and if we restrict to $j$ such that $\gcd(n, j) = 1$, this yields $\phi(n)$ maps.
Noting that if $\zeta$ is a primitive root, then $(n, j) = 1$ implies that that $\zeta^j$ is also a primitive root, and hence another root of $\min(\zeta, \QQ)$, and so these are in fact automorphisms of $K$ that fix $\QQ$ and thus elements of $\Gal(K/\QQ)$.

So define a map
\[
\theta: \ZZ_n\units &\to K \\
[j]_n &\mapsto \tau_j
.\]

from the *multiplicative* group of units to the Galois group.

The claim is that this is a surjective homomorphism, and since both groups are the same size, an isomorphism.

:::{.proof title="of surjectivity"}
Letting $\sigma \in K$ be arbitrary, noting that $[K: \QQ]$ has a basis $\theset{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}}$, it suffices to specify $\sigma(\zeta)$ to fully determine the automorphism.
(Since $\sigma(\zeta^k) = \sigma(\zeta)^k$.)

In particular, $\sigma(\zeta)$ satisfies the polynomial $x^n - 1$, since $\sigma(\zeta)^n = \sigma(\zeta^n) = \sigma(1) = 1$, which means $\sigma(\zeta)$ is another root of unity and $\sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^k$ for some $1\leq k \leq n$.

Moreover, since $o(\zeta) = n \in K\units$, we must have $o(\zeta^k) = n \in K\units$ as well. Noting that $\theset{\zeta^i}$ forms a cyclic subgroup $H\leq K\units$, then $o(\zeta^k) = n \iff (n, k) = 1$ (by general theory of cyclic groups).

Thus $\theta$ is surjective.

We can consider the quotient $K = \displaystyle{\frac{\FF_p[x]}{\generators{\pi(x)}}}$, which since $\pi(x)$ is irreducible is an extension of $\FF_p$ of degree $d$ and thus a field of size $p^d$ with a natural quotient map of rings $\rho: \FF_p[x] \to K$.

Since $K\units$ is a group of size $p^d-1$, we know that for any $y \in K\units$, we have by Lagrange's theorem that the order of $y$ divides $p^d-1$ and so $y^{p^d} = y$.

So every element in $K$ is a root of $q(x) = x^{p^d}-x$.

    - $\zeta = e^{2\pi i / 8} = \sin(\pi/4) + i\cos(\pi/4) = {\sqrt 2 \over 2}\qty{1+i}$.

- Thus $L = \QQ(i, \sqrt{2})(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \QQ(i, \sqrt 2, \sqrt[4] 2) = \QQ(i, \sqrt[4]{2})$.
  - Uses the fact that $\QQ(\sqrt 2) \subseteq \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)$ since $\sqrt[4]{2}^2 = \sqrt{2}$ 

- Conclude
\[
[L: \QQ] = [L: \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)] ~[\QQ(\sqrt[4] 2): \QQ] = 2 \cdot 4 = 8

- $L/K$ is separable, since $F[x] \subseteq K[x]$, and so if $\alpha \in L$ where $f(x) \definedas \min(\alpha, F)$ has no repeated factors, then $f'(x) \definedas \min(\alpha, K)$ divides $f$ and thus can not have repeated factors.

:::{.proof title="of c"}
**False**: 
Use the fact that every quadratic extension is Galois, and take $L/K/F = \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2) \to \QQ(\sqrt 2) \to \QQ$.

Then each successive extension is quadratic (thus Galois) but $\QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)$ is not the splitting field of any polynomial (noting that it does not split $x^4 - 2$ completely.)

Note that $g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 2$ has roots $\beta = 2 \pm \sqrt{2}$, and so $f$ has roots 
\[
\alpha_1 &= \sqrt{2 + \sqrt 2} \\
\alpha_2 &= \sqrt{2 - \sqrt 2} \\
\alpha_3 &= -\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_4 &= -\alpha_2
.\]

and splitting field $K = \QQ(\theset{\alpha_i})$.

:::

:::{.proof title="of b"}
$K$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial and thus Galois over $\QQ$.
Moreover, Since $f$ is irreducible by Eisenstein with $p=2$, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S^4$, so the possibilities are:

- $S_4$
- $A_4$
- $D_4$
- $\ZZ/(2) \cross \ZZ/(2)$
- $\ZZ/(4)$

We can note that $g$ splits over $L \definedas \QQ(\sqrt 2)$, an extension of degree 2.

We can now note that $\min(\alpha, L)$ is given by $p(x) = x^2 - (2 + \sqrt 2)$, and so $[K: L] = 2$.

We then have
\[
[K: \QQ] = [K: L] [L : \QQ] = (2)(2) = 4
.\]

This $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = 4$, which leaves only two possibilities:

- $\ZZ/(2) \cross \ZZ/(2)$
- $\ZZ/(4)$

We can next check orders of elements.
Take
\[
\sigma &\in \Gal(K/\QQ) \\
\alpha_1 &\mapsto \alpha_2
.\]


Computations show that 

- $\alpha_1^2 \alpha_2^2 = 2$, so $\alpha_1 \alpha_2 = \sqrt 2$
- $\alpha_1^2 = 2 + \sqrt 2 \implies \sqrt 2 = \alpha_1^2 - 2$

and thus
\[
\sigma^2(\alpha_1) &= \sigma(\alpha_2) \\
&= \sigma\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\alpha_1}\right) \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\sqrt 2)}{\sigma(\alpha_1)} \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\alpha_1^2 - 2)}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \frac{\alpha_2^2 - 2}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -2\alpha_2\inv \\
&= \alpha_2 - \frac{2\alpha_1}{\sqrt 2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -\alpha_1 \sqrt 2 \\
&\neq \alpha_1
,\]

and so the order of $\sigma$ is strictly greater than 2, and thus 4, and thus $\Gal(K/\QQ) = \theset{\sigma^k \suchthat 1\leq k \leq 4} \cong \ZZ/(4)$.

:::{.proof title="of a"}
By the Galois correspondence, it suffices to show that the fixed field of $H_1 \intersect H_2$ is $E_1 E_2$.

Let $\sigma \in H_1 \intersect H_2$; then $\sigma \in \Aut(K)$ fixes both $E_1$ and $E_2$.

> Not sure if this works -- compositum is not literally product..?

Writing $x \in E_1E_2$ as $x=e_1 e_2$, we have 
$$
\sigma(x) = \sigma(e_1 e_2) = \sigma(e_1) \sigma(e_2) = e_1 e_2  =x,
$$

so $\sigma$ fixes $E_1 E_2$.

:::

:::{.proof title="of b"}
That $H_1 H_2 \subseteq G$ is clear, since if $\sigma = \tau_1 \tau_2 \in H_1 H_2$, then each $\tau_i$ is an automorphism of $K$ that fixes $E_i \supseteq \QQ$, so each $\tau_i$ fixes $\QQ$ and thus $\sigma$ fixes $\QQ$.

- Let $\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \in H_1 H_2$.

- Note that $\sigma_1(e) = e$ for all $e\in E_1$ by definition, since $H_1$ fixes $E_1$, and $\sigma_2(e) \in E_1$ (?).

- Then 
  \[
  \sigma_1(e) = e \quad \forall e \in E_1 \implies \sigma_1(\sigma_2(e)) = \sigma_2(e) 
  \]
  and substituting $e = \sigma_1(e)$ on the RHS yields
  \[
  \sigma_1 \sigma_2(e) = \sigma_2 \sigma_1(e)
  ,\]
  where a similar proof holds for $e\in E_2$ and thus for arbitrary $x\in E_1 E_2$.

By the Galois correspondence, the subgroup $H_1H_2 \leq G$ will correspond to an intermediate field $E$ such that $K/E/\QQ$ and $E$ is the fixed field of $H_1 H_2$.

But if $\sigma \in H_1 H_2$, then $\sigma = \tau_1 \tau_2$ where $\tau_i$ is an automorphism of $K$ that fixes $E_i$, and so $\sigma(x) = x \iff \tau_1\tau_2(x) = x \iff \tau_2(x) = x ~\&~ \tau_1(x) = x \iff x \in E_1 \intersect E_2$.

It suffices to show that

We have
\[
t_1 \in \Tor(M) &\implies \exists s_1 \neq 0 \text{ such that } s_1 t_1  = 0 \\
t_2 \in \Tor(M) &\implies \exists s_2 \neq 0 \text{ such that } s_2 t_2  = 0

Since $R$ is an integral domain, $s_1 s_2 \neq 0$.

Let $R = \ZZ/6\ZZ$ as a $\ZZ/6\ZZ \dash$module, which is not an integral domain as a ring.

Then $[3]_6\actson [2]_6 = [0]_6$ and $[2]_6\actson [3]_6 = [0]_6$, but $[2]_6 + [3]_6 = [5]_6$, where 5 is coprime to 6, and thus $[n]_6\actson [5]_6 = [0] \implies [n]_6 = [0]_6$. So $[5]_6$ is *not* a torsion element.

So the set of torsion elements are not closed under addition, and thus not a submodule.

- Then using the definition of coset addition/multiplication, we can write this as
\[  
\sum_{i=1}^n \qty { s_i \vector r_i + \tor(M)} = 
\qty{ \sum_{i=1}^n  s_i \vector r_i} + \tor(M)  = 0_{\tilde M}
.\]

- Since $\tilde{\vector x} = 0 \in \tilde M \iff \tilde{\vector x} = \vector x + \tor(M)$ where $\vector x \in \tor(M)$, this forces $\sum s_i \vector r_i \in \tor(M)$.

- Then there exists a scalar $\alpha\in R\nonzero$ such that $\alpha \sum s_i \vector r_i = 0_M$.

- Since $R$ is an integral domain and $\alpha \neq 0$, we must have $\sum s_i \vector r_i = 0_M$.

- Since $\theset{\vector r_i}$ was linearly independent in $M$, we must have $s_i = 0_R$ for all $i$.

- Since $\mathcal B$ is a basis for $M$, we have $\vector m = \sum_{i=1}^n s_i \vector r_i$, and so
\[

- **Claim**: If $I\subseteq R$ is an ideal *and* a free $R\dash$module, then $I$ is principal .

  - Suppose $I$ is free and let $I = \generators{B}$ for some basis, we will show $\abs{B} = 1$>
  
  - Toward a contradiction, suppose $\abs{B} \geq 2$ and let $m_1, m_2\in B$.
  
  - Then  since $R$ is commutative, $m_2 m_1 - m_1 m_2 = 0$ and this yields a linear dependence
  
  - So $B$ has only one element $m$.

  - But then $I = \gens{m} = R_m$ is cyclic as an $R\dash$ module and thus principal as an ideal of $R$. 

  - Now since $M$ was assumed to *not* be principal, $M$ is not free (using the contrapositive of the claim).


:::

:::{.proof title="that $M$ is rank 1"}
\envlist

- For any module, we can take an element $\vector m\in M\nonzero$ and consider the cyclic submodule $R\vector m$.

- Since $M$ is not principle, it is not the zero ideal, and contains at least two elements. So we can consider an element $\vector m\in M$.

- We have $\rank_R(M) \geq 1$, since $R\vector m \leq M$ and $\theset{m}$ is a subset of some spanning set.

- $R\vector m$ can not be linearly dependent, since $R$ is an integral domain and $M\subseteq R$, so $\alpha \vector m = \vector 0 \implies \alpha = 0_R$.

- Claim: since $R$ is commutative, $\rank_R(M) \leq 1$.

  - If we take two elements $\vector m, \vector n \in M\nonzero$, then since $m, n\in R$ as well, we have $nm = mn$ and so
\[
(n)\vector m + (-m)\vector n = 0_R = \vector 0
\]
  is a linear dependence.

**$M$ is torsion-free**:

- Let $\vector x \in \tor M$, then there exists some $r\neq 0\in R$ such that $r\vector x = \vector 0$.

- But $\vector x\in R$ as well and $R$ is an integral domain, so $\vector x=0_R$, and thus $\tor(M) = \theset{0_R}$.

An $R\dash$module $M$ is **free** if any of the following conditions hold:

- $M \cong \bigoplus_{\alpha} R$ are isomorphic as $R\dash$modules.
- There is a nonempty set $X$ and an inclusion $X\injects M$ such that for every $R\dash$modules $N$, every map $X\to N$ lifts to a unique map $M\to N$, so the following diagram commutes:

- Let the following be an SES where $F$ is a free $R\dash$module:
\[

- Since $F$ is free, there is a generating set $X = \theset{x_\alpha}$ and a map $\iota:X\injects M$ satisfying the 3rd property from (a).
  If we construct a map $f: X\to M$, then the universal property of free modules will give a lift $\tilde f: F\to M$
- $\theset{\iota(x_\alpha)} \subseteq F$ and $\pi$ is surjective, so choose fibers $\theset{y_\alpha} \subseteq M$ such that $\pi(y_\alpha) = \iota(x_\alpha)$ and define
\[
f: X&\to M \\
x_\alpha &\mapsto y_\alpha
.\]
- The universal property yields $h: F\to M$:

0 \ar[r]& N \ar[r] & M\ar[r, "\pi"'] & \ar[l, bend right, dotted ,"\exists ! h"'] F \ar[r] & 0

- It remains to check that it's a section:
\[
f\in F \implies f = \sum_\alpha r_\alpha { \iota(x_\alpha) } \\
\implies (\pi \circ h)(f) 
&= \pi \qty{h\qty{\sum_\alpha r_\alpha \iota(x_\alpha) }}  \\

:::{.claim}
If $A \in \Gl(m, \FF)$ is invertible and $A^n/\FF$ is diagonalizable, then $A/\FF$ is diagonalizable.
:::

Let $A \in \Gl(m, \FF)$. 
Since $A^n$ is diagonalizable, $\min_{A^n}(x) \in \FF[x]$ is separable and thus factors as a product of $m$ **distinct** linear factors:

$$
\min_{A^n}(x) = \prod_{i=1}^m (x-\lambda_i), \quad \min_{A^n}(A^n) = 0
$$

where $\theset{\lambda_i}_{i=1}^m \subset \FF$ are the **distinct** eigenvalues of $A^n$.

Moreover $A\in \GL(m,\FF) \implies A^n \in \GL(m,\FF)$: $A$ is invertible $\iff \det(A) = d \in \FF\units$, and so $\det(A^n) = \det(A)^n = d^n \in \FF\units$ using the fact that the determinant is a ring morphism $\det: \mat (m\times m) \to\FF$ and $\FF\units$ is closed under multiplication.

So $A^n$ is invertible, and thus has trivial kernel, and thus zero is not an eigenvalue, so $\lambda_i \neq 0$ for any $i$.

Since the $\lambda_i$ are distinct and nonzero, this implies $x^k$ is not a factor of $\mu_{A^n}(x)$ for any $k\geq 0$. 
Thus the $m$ terms in the product correspond to precisely $m$ **distinct linear** factors.

We can now construct a polynomial that annihilates $A$, namely
$$
q_A(x) \definedas \min_{A^n}(x^n) = \prod_{i=1}^m (x^n-\lambda_i) \in \FF[x],
$$

where we can note that $q_A(A) = \min_{A^n}(A^n) = 0$, and so $\min_A(x) \divides q_A(x)$ by minimality.

We now claim that $q_A(x)$ has exactly $n\cdot m$ distinct linear factors in $\bar \FF[x]$, which reduces to showing that no pair $x^n-\lambda_i, x^n-\lambda_j$ share a root.
and that $x^n-\lambda_i$ does not have multiple roots.

- For the first claim, we can factor
  \[
  x^n - \lambda_i = \prod_{k=1}^n (x - \lambda_i^{1\over n} e^{2\pi i k \over n}) \definedas \prod_{k=1}^n (x-\lambda^{1\over n} \zeta_n^k)
  ,\]
  where we now use the fact that $i\neq j \implies \lambda_i^{1\over n} \neq \lambda_j^{1\over n}$. 
  Thus no term in the above product appears as a factor in $x^n - \lambda_j$ for $j\neq i$.

- For the second claim, we can check that $\dd{}{x}\qty{x^n - \lambda_i} = nx^{n-1}\neq 0\in \FF$, and $\gcd(x^n-\lambda_i, nx^{n-1}) = 1$ since the latter term has only the roots $x=0$ with multiplicity $n-1$, whereas $\lambda_i\neq 0 \implies$ zero is not a root of $x^n-\lambda_i$.

But now since $q_A(x)$ has exactly distinct linear factors in $\bar \FF[x]$ and $\min_A(x) \divides q_A(x)$, $\min_A(x) \in \FF[x]$ can only have distinct linear factors, and $A$ is thus diagonalizable over $\FF$.

Let $G = \GL(3, \QQ[x])$ be the group of invertible $3\times 3$ matrices over $\QQ[x]$.

## Fall 2015 #8 $\work$
Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ and $V\dual$ its dual.
A *symmetric bilinear form* $(\wait, \wait)$ on $V$ is a map $V\cross V\to F$ satisfying
\[
(av_1 + b v_2, w) = a(v_1, w) + b(v_2, w) \qtext{and} (v_1, v_2) = (v_2, v_1)
\]
for all $a, b\in F$ and $v_1, v_2 \in V$.
The form is *nondegenerate* if the only element $w\in V$ satisfying $(v, w) = 0$ for all $v\in V$ is $w=0$.

Suppose $(\wait, \wait)$ is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on $V$.
If $W$ is a subspace of $V$, define
\[
W\perp \definedas \theset{v\in V \suchthat (v, w) = 0 \text{ for all } w\in W}
.\]

a.
Show that if $X, Y$ are subspaces of $V$ with $Y\subset X$, then $X\perp \subseteq Y\perp$.

b.
Define an injective linear map 
\[
\psi: Y\perp/X\perp \injects (X/Y)\dual
\]
which is an isomorphism if $V$ is finite dimensional.

##  Fall 2018 #4 $\done$ 
Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a field (the field is not necessarily algebraically closed).

Let $\phi : V \to V$ be a linear transformation. Prove that there exists a decomposition of $V$ as $V = U \oplus W$ , where $U$ and $W$ are $\phi\dash$invariant subspaces of $V$ , $\restrictionof{\phi}{U}$ is nilpotent, and $\restrictionof{\phi}{W}$ is nonsingular.

\todo[inline]{Revisit.}

:::{.solution}
Let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\phi$.
If the polynomial $f(x) = x$ doesn't divide $m$, then $f$ does not have zero as an eigenvalue, so $\phi$ is nonsingular and since $0$ is nilpotent, $\phi + 0$ works.

Otherwise, write $\phi(x) = x^m \rho(x)$ where $\gcd(x, \rho(x)) = 1$.

Then
\[
V \cong \frac{k[x]}{m(x)} \cong \frac{k[x]}{(x^m)} \oplus \frac{k[x]}{(\rho)}
\definedas U \oplus W
\]
by the Chinese Remainder theorem.

We can now note that $\restrictionof{\phi}{U}$ is nilpotent because it has characteristic polynomial $x^m$, and $\restrictionof{\phi}{W}$ is nonsingular since $\lambda = 0$ is not an eigenvalue by construction.

:::{.proof title="of a"}
Letting $\vector v$ be fixed, since $\theset{A^j \vector v}$ spans $V$ we have A
\[
B\vector v = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_j A^j \vector v
.\]

So let $p(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_jx^j$.
Then consider how $B$ acts on any basis vector $A^k \vector v$.

We have 
\[
BA^k \vector v 
&= A^k B\vector v \\
&= A^k p(A) \vector v \\
&= p(A) A^k \vector v
,\]

so $B = p(A)$ as operators since their actions agree on every basis vector in $V$.

:::

:::{.proof title="of b, $\implies$"}
$\implies$:

If $\theset{A^j \vector v_k \suchthat 0\leq j \leq n-1}$ is linearly independent, this means that $A$ does satisfy any polynomial of degree $d < n$.

So $\deg m_A(x) = n$, and since $m_A(x)$ divides $\chi_A(x)$ and both are monic degree polynomials of degree $n$, they must be equal.


:::

:::{.proof title="of b, $\impliedby$"}
$\impliedby$:

Let $A\actson k[x]$ by $A \actson p(x) \definedas p(A)$.
This induces an invariant factor decomposition $V =\cong \bigoplus k[x]/(f_i)$.
Since the product of the invariant factors is the characteristic polynomial, the largest invariant factor is the minimal polynomial, and these two are equal, there can only be one invariant factor and thus the invariant factor decomposition is
$$
V\cong \frac{k[x]}{(\chi_A(x))}
$$
as an isomorphism of $k[x]\dash$modules.

So $V$ is a cyclic $k[x]$ module, which means that $V = k[x]\actson \vector v$ for some $\vector v\in V$ such that $\ann(\vector v) = \chi_A(x)$, i.e. there is some element $\vector v\in V$ whose orbit is all of $V$.

But then noting that monomials span $k[x]$ as a $k\dash$module, we can write
\[
V &\cong
k[x] \actson \vector v \\
&\definedas \theset{f(x) \actson \vector v \suchthat f \in k[x]} \\
&= \spanof_k \theset{x^k \actson \vector v \suchthat k \geq 0} \\
&\definedas \spanof_k \theset{A^k\vector v \suchthat k \geq 0}
.\]

Moreover, we can note that if $\ell \geq \deg \chi_A(x)$, then $A^\ell$ is a linear combination of $\theset{A^j \mid 0 \leq j \leq n-1}$, and so
\[
V &\cong \spanof_k \theset{A^\ell\vector v \suchthat \ell \geq 0} \\
&= \spanof_k \theset{A^\ell \vector v \suchthat 1 \leq \ell \leq n-1}
.\]

:::{.proof title="of a"}
Let $\vector v \in \Lambda$, so $\vector v = \sum_{i=1}^n r_i \vector e_i$ where $r_i \in \ZZ$ for all $i$.

Then if $\vector x = \sum_{j=1}^n s_j \vector e_j \in \Lambda$ is arbitrary, we have $s_j \in \ZZ$ for all $j$ and 
\[
\inner{\vector v}{\vector x} 
&= \inner{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \vector e_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n s_j \vector e_j } \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n r_i s_j \inner{\vector e_i}{\vector e_j }  \in \ZZ
\]

since this is a sum of products of integers (since $\inner{\vector e_i}{\vector e_j} \in \ZZ$ for each $i, j$ pair by assumption) so $\vector v \in \Lambda\dual$ by definition.

:::

:::{.proof title="of b"}
**The determinant is nonzero**:

Suppose $\det M = 0$. Then $\ker M \neq \vector 0$, so let $\vector v \in \ker M$ be given by $\vector v = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i \vector e_i \neq \vector 0$. 

Note that 
\[
M\vector v = 0 &\implies
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\vector e_1 \cdot \vector e_1 & \vector e_1 \cdot \vector e_2 & \cdots \\
\vector e_2 \cdot \vector e_1 & \vector e_2 \cdot \vector e_2 & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{array}
\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots
\end{array}\right] = \vector 0 \\ \\
&\implies \sum_{j=1}^n v_j\inner{\vector e_k}{\vector e_j} = 0 \qtext{for each fixed} k
.\]

We can now note that $\inner{\vector e_k}{\vector v} = \sum_{j=1}^n v_j \inner{\vector e_k}{\vector e_j} = 0$ for every $k$ by the above observation, which forces $\vector v = 0$ by non-degeneracy of $\inner{\wait}{\wait}$, a contradiction.

Write $M = A^tA$ where $A$ has the $\vector e_i$ as columns. Then
\[
M\vector x = 0 
&\implies A^t A \vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \vector x^t A^t A \vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \norm{A \vector x}^2  = 0 \\
&\implies A\vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \vector x = 0

since $A$ has full rank because the $\vector e_i$ are linearly independent.

Let $A = [\vector e_1^t, \cdots, \vector e_n^t]$ be the matrix with $\vector e_i$ in the $i$th column.

**The rows of $A\inv$ span $\Lambda\dual$**:

Equivalently, the columns of $A^{-t}$ span $\Lambda\dual$.

Let $B = A^{-t}$ and let $\vector b_i$ denote the columns of $B$, so $\im B = \spanof{\theset{\vector b_i}}$.


Since $A \in \GL(n, \ZZ)$, $A\inv, A^t, A^{-t} \in \GL(n, \ZZ)$ as well.

\[
\vector v \in \Lambda\dual 
&\implies \inner{\vector e_i}{\vector v} = z_i \in \ZZ \quad \forall i \\
&\implies A^t \vector v = \vector z \definedas [z_1, \cdots, z_n] \in \ZZ^n \\
&\implies \vector v = A^{-t} \vector z \definedas B\vector z \in \im B \\
&\implies \vector v \in \im B \\
&\implies \Lambda\dual \subseteq \im B

and

\[
B^t A = (A^{-t})^t A = A\inv A = I \\
\implies \vector b_i \cdot \vector e_j = \delta_{ij} \in \ZZ \\
\implies \im B \subseteq \spanof~ \Lambda\dual

Let $f$ be the characteristic polynomial of $T$.

:::{.proof title="of a, $\implies$. Matrix-dependent"}
$\implies$:

- By contrapositive, suppose there is a proper nonzero invariant subspace $W<V$ with $T(W) \subseteq W$, we will show the characteristic polynomial $f \definedas \chi_{V, T}(x)$ is reducible.
- Since $T(W)\subseteq W$, the restriction $g\definedas \chi_{V, T}(x) \mid_W: W\to W$ is a linear operator on $W$.


:::{.claim}
$g$ divides $f$ in $\FF[x]$ and $\deg(g) < \deg(f)$.
:::

- Choose an ordered basis for $W$, say $\mcb_W \definedas \theset{\vector w_1, \cdots, \vector w_k}$ where $k=\dim_F(W)$
- Claim: this can be extended to a basis of $V$, say $\mcb_V \definedas \theset{\vector w_1, \cdots, \vector w_k, \vector v_1, \cdots, \vector v_j}$ where $k+j = \dim_F(V)$.
  - Note that since $W<V$ is proper, $j\geq 1$.
- Restrict $T$ to $W$ to get $T_W$, then let $B = [T_W]_{\mcb_W}$ be the matrix representation of $T_W$ with respect to $\mcb_W$.
- Now consider the matrix representation $[T]_{\mcb_V}$, in block form this is given by
\[
[T]_{\mcb_V} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
B & C \\
0 & D
\end{bmatrix}
\]
  where we've used that $W<V$ is proper to get the existence of $C, D$ (there is at least one additional row/column since $j\geq 1$ in the extended basis.)
\todo[inline]{Why?}

- Now expand along the first column block to obtain
\[
\chi_{T, V}(x) \definedas \det([T]_{\mcb_V} - xI) = \det(B - xI)\cdot \det(D - xI) \definedas \chi_{T, W}(x) \cdot \det(D-xI)
.\]

- Claim: $\det(D - xI) \in xF[x]$ is nontrivial

- The claim follows because this forces $\deg(\det(D-xI)) \geq 1$ and so $\chi_{T, W}(x)$ is a proper divisor of $\chi_{T, V}(x)$.

- Thus $f$ is reducible.

- Suppose $f$ is reducible, then we will produce a proper $T\dash$invariant subspace.
- Claim: if $f$ is reducible, there exists a nonzero, noncyclic vector $\vector v$.

- Let $\min_{T, F}(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $T$ and $\chi_{T, F}(x)$ be its characteristic polynomial.
- By Cayley-Hamilton, $\min_{T, F}(x)$ divides $\chi_{T, F}$
- Since $\chi_{T, F}$ is irreducible, these polynomials are equal.
- Claim: $T/F$ is diagonalizable $\iff \min_{T, F}$ splits over $F$ and is squarefree.
- Replace $F$ with its algebraic closure, then $\min_{T, F}$ splits.
- Claim: in characteristic zero, every irreducible polynomial is separable
  - Proof: it must be the case that either $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ or $f' \equiv 0$, where the second case only happens in characteristic $p>0$.
  - The first case is true because $\deg f' < \deg f$, and if $\gcd(f, f') = p$, then $\deg p < \deg f$ and $p\divides f$ forces $p=1$ since $f$ is irreducible.
- So $\min_{T, F}$ splits into distinct linear factors
- Thus $T$ is diagonalizable.

:::{.proof title="of a"}
Let $A$ be the matrix in the question, and $B$ be the matrix containing 1's in every entry.

- Noting that $B = A+I$, we have
  \[
  &B\vector x = \lambda \vector x \\
  &\iff (A+I) \vector x = \lambda \vector x \\
  &\iff A \vector x = (\lambda - 1) \vector x
  ,\]
    so we will find the eigenvalues of $B$ and subtract one from each.

- Note that $B\vector v = \thevector{\sum v_i, \sum v_i, \cdots, \sum v_i}$, i.e. it has the effect of summing all of the entries of $\vector v$ and placing that sum in each component.

- We proceed by finding $p$ eigenvectors and eigenvalues, since the JCF and minimal polynomials will involve eigenvalues and the transformation matrix will involve (generalized) eigenvectors.

:::{.claim title="1"}
Each vector of the form $\vector p_i \definedas \vector e_1 - \vector e_{i+1} = \thevector{1, 0, 0,\cdots, 0 -1, 0, \cdots, 0 }$ where $i\neq j$ is also an eigenvector with eigenvalues $\lambda_0 = 0$, and this gives $p-1$ linearly independent vectors spanning the eigenspace $E_{\lambda_0}$
:::

:::{.claim title="2"}
$\vector v_1 = \thevector{1, 1, \cdots, 1}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = p$.
:::

- Using that the eigenvalues of $A$ are $1+\lambda_i$ for $\lambda_i$ the above eigenvalues for $B$,
\[
\spec(B) \definedas \theset{(\lambda_i, m_i)} &=  \theset{(p, 1), (0, p-1)}  \implies \chi_{B}(x) = (x-p)x^{p-1} \\ 
\implies \spec(A) &= \theset{(p-1,1), (-1, p-1) }  \implies \chi_{A}(x) = (x- p+1)(x+1)^{p-1} \\
\]

- The dimensions of eigenspaces are preserved, thus
\[
JCF_\QQ(A)
=  J_{p-1}^{1} \oplus (p-1)J_{-1}^1
=
\left[\begin{array}{r|r|r|r|r|r}
p-1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\

0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & -1 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\]

- The matrix $P$ such that $A = PJP\inv$ will have columns the bases of the generalized eigenspaces.
- In this case, the generalized eigenspaces are the usual eigenspaces, so
\[
P = [\vector v_1, \vector p_1, \cdots, \vector p_{p-1}] =

- Compute $$B \vector p_i = \thevector{ 1 + 0 + \cdots + 0 + (-1) + 0 + \cdots + 0} = \thevector{0, 0, \cdots, 0}$$
- So every $\vector p_i \in \ker(B)$, so they are eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0.
- Since the first component is fixed and we have $p-1$ choices for where to place a $-1$, this yields $p-1$ possibilities for $\vector p_i$
- These are linearly independent since the $(p-1)\times (p-1)$ matrix $\thevector{ \vector p_1^t, \cdots, \vector p_{p-1}^t}$ satisfies
\[
\det 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
-1 & 0  & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & -1  & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0  & 0 & \cdots & -1\\
\end{bmatrix}
&= (1) \cdot \det 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0  & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & -1  & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0  & 0 & \cdots & -1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\\
&= (-1)^{p-2} \neq 0
.\]

where the first equality follows from expanding along the first row and noting this is the first minor, and every other minor contains a row of zeros.

- Compute $$B\vector v = \thevector{\sum_{i=1}^p 1, \sum_{i=1}^p 1, \cdots, \sum_{i=1}^p 1} = \thevector{p, p, \cdots, p} = p \thevector{1, 1, \cdots, 1} = p\vector{v}_1,$$ thus $\lambda_1 = p$
- $\dim E_{\lambda_1} = 1$ since the eigenspaces are orthogonal and $E_{\lambda_0} \oplus E_{\lambda_1} \leq F^p$ is a subspace, so $p > \dim(E_{\lambda_0}) + \dim E_{\lambda_1} = p-1 + \dim E_{\lambda_1}$ and it isn't zero dimensional.

:::{.proof title="of b"}
For $F = \FF_p$, all eigenvalues/vectors still lie in $\FF_p$, but now $-1 = p-1$, making $(x-(p-1))(x+1)^{p-1} = (x+1)(x+1)^{p-1}$, so $\chi_{A, \FF_p}(x) = (x+1)^p$, and the Jordan blocks may merge.

- A computation shows that $(A+I)^2 = pA = 0 \in M_p(\FF_p)$ and $(A+I) \neq 0$, so $\min_{A, \FF_p}(x) = (x+1)^2$.
  - Thus the largest Jordan block corresponding to $\lambda = -1$ is of size 2
- Can check that $\det(A) = \pm 1 \in \FF_p\units$, so the vectors $\vector e_1 - \vector e_i$ are still linearly independent and thus $\dim E_{-1} = p-1$
  - So there are $p-1$ Jordan blocks for $\lambda = 0$.

Summary:
\[
\min_{A, \FF_p}(x) &= (x+1)^2 \\
\chi_{A, \FF_p}(x) &\equiv (x+1)^p \\
\dim E_{-1} &= p-1
.\]

Thus
\[
JCF_{\FF_p}(A)
=  J_{-1}^{2} \oplus (p-2)J_{-1}^1
= \left[\begin{array}{rr|r|r|r|r}
-1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0& -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0& 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & -1 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\]

To obtain a basis for $E_{\lambda = 0}$, first note that the matrix $P = [\vector v_1, \vector p_1, \cdots , \vector p_{p-1}]$ from part (a) is singular over $\FF_p$, since
\[
\vector v_1 + \vector p_1 + \vector p_2 + \cdots + \vector p_{p-2}
&= [p-1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0, 1] \\
&= [-1, 0,0,\cdots, 0, 1] \\
&= - \vector p_{p-1}
.\]

We still have a linearly independent set given by the first $p-1$ columns of $P$, so we can extend this to a basis by finding one linearly independent generalized eigenvector.

Solving $(A-I\lambda)\vector x = \vector v_1$ is our only option (the others won't yield solutions).
This amounts to solving $B\vector x = \vector v_1$, which imposes the condition $\sum x_i = 1$, so we can choose $\vector x = [1, 0, \cdots, 0]$.

Thus
\[
P = [\vector v_1, \vector x, \vector p_1, \cdots, \vector p_{p-2}] =
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  \\
1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\]
