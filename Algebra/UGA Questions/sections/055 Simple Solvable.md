# Groups: Simple and Solvable

## $\star$ Fall 2016 #7 $\work$

### a
Define what it means for a group $G$ to be *solvable*.

### a
Show that every group $G$ of order 36 is solvable.

> Hint: you can use that $S_4$ is solvable.

## Spring 2015 #4 $\work$
Let $N$ be a positive integer, and let $G$ be a finite group of order $N$.

### a
Let $\sym G$ be the set of all bijections from $G\to G$ viewed as a group under composition.
Note that $\sym G \cong S_N$.
Prove that the Cayley map 
\[
C: G&\to \sym G\\
g &\mapsto (x\mapsto gx)
\]
is an injective homomorphism.

### a
Let $\Phi: \sym G\to S_N$ be an isomorphism.
For $a\in G$ define $\eps(a) \in \theset{\pm 1}$ to be the sign of the permutation $\Phi(C(a))$.
Suppose that $a$ has order $d$.
Prove that $\eps(a) = -1 \iff d$ is even and $N/d$ is odd.

### c
Suppose $N> 2$ and $n\equiv 2 \mod 4$.
Prove that $G$ is not simple.

> Hint: use part (b).


## Spring 2014 #1 $\work$
Let $p, n$ be integers such that $p$ is prime and $p$ does not divide $n$.
Find a real number $k = k (p, n)$ such that for every integer $m\geq k$, every group of order $p^m n$ is not simple.

## Fall 2013 #1 $\work$
Let $p, q$ be distinct primes.

### a
Let $\bar q \in \ZZ_p$ be the class of $q\mod p$ and let $k$ denote the order of $\bar q$ as an element of $\ZZ_p\units$.

Prove that no group of order $pq^k$ is simple.

### a
Let $G$ be a group of order $pq$, and prove that $G$ is not simple.

## Spring 2013 #4  $\work$
Define a *simple group*.

Prove that a group of order 56 can not be simple.

## Fall 2019 Midterm #3 $\work$
Show that there exist no simple groups of order 148.
