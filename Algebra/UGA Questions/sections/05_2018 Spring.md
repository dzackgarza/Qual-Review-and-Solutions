(b) Prove that any group of order $p^2$ (where $p$ is prime) is abelian.

(c) Prove that any group of order $5^2 \cdot 7^2$ is abelian.

(d) Write down exactly one representative in each isomorphism class of groups of order $5^2 \cdot 7^2$.

## 2.

(a) Find the splitting field $K$ of $f$, and compute $[K: \QQ]$.

(b) Find the Galois group $G$ of $f$, both as an explicit group of automorphisms, and as a familiar abstract group to which it is isomorphic.

(c) Exhibit explicitly the correspondence between subgroups of $G$ and intermediate fields between $\QQ$ and $k$.


## 3.

Let $K$ be a Galois extension of $\QQ$ with Galois group $G$, and let $E_1 , E_2$ be intermediate fields of $K$ which are the splitting fields of irreducible $f_i (x) \in \QQ[x]$.

## 4.

Let

$$
A=\left[\begin{array}{lll}{0} & {1} & {-2} \\ {1} & {1} & {-3} \\ {1} & {2} & {-4}\end{array}\right] \in M_{3}(\mathbb{C})

(a) Find the Jordan canonical form J of A.

(b) Find an invertible matrix $P$ such that $P\inv AP = J$.

Prove that
$$
M N=\left(\begin{array}{ll}{0} & {0} \\ {0} & {*}\end{array}\right)
\implies MN = 0

## 6.

Let
$$
M = \{(w, x, y, z) \in \ZZ^4 \suchthat w + x + y + z \in 2\ZZ\}
,$$

and

$$
N = \{(w, x, y, z) \in \ZZ^4 \suchthat 4\divides (w - x),~ 4\divides (x - y),~ 4\divides ( y - z)\}
.$$

(a) Show that $N$ is a $\ZZ\dash$submodule of $M$ .

(b) Find vectors $u_1 , u_2 , u_3 , u_4 \in \ZZ^4$ and integers $d_1 , d_2 , d_3 , d_4$ such that
$$
\{u_1 , u_2 , u_3 , u_4 \}
$$
is a free basis for $M$, and
$$
\{d_1 u_1,~ d_2 u_2,~ d_3 u_3,~ d_4 u_4 \}
$$
is a free basis for $N$ .

(c) Use the previous part to describe $M/N$ as a direct sum of cyclic $\ZZ\dash$modules.


## 7.

Let $R$ be a PID and $M$ be an $R\dash$module. Let $p$ be a prime element of $R$. The module $M$ is called *$\generators{p}\dash$primary* if for every $m \in M$ there exists $k > 0$ such that $p^k m = 0$.

(a) Suppose M is $\generators{p}\dash$primary. Show that if $m \in M$ and $t \in R, ~t \not\in \generators{p}$, then there exists $a \in R$ such that
$atm = m$.

(b) A submodule $S$ of $M$ is said to be *pure* if $S \cap r M = rS$ for all $r \in R$. Show that if $M$ is $\generators{p}\dash$primary, then $S$ is pure if and only if $S \cap p^k M = p^k S$ for all $k \geq 0$.

## 8.

Let $R = C[0, 1]$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on the interval $[0, 1]$. Let I be an ideal of $R$.

(a) Show that if $f \in I, a \in [0, 1]$ are such that $f (a) \neq 0$, then there exists $g \in I$ such that $g(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in [0, 1]$, and $g(x) > 0$ for all $x$ in some open neighborhood of $a$.

(b) If $I \neq R$, show that the set $Z(I) = \{x \in [0, 1] \suchthat f(x) = 0 \text{ for all } f \in I\}$ is nonempty.

(c) Show that if $I$ is maximal, then there exists $x_0 \in [0, 1]$ such that $I = \{ f \in R \suchthat f (x_0 ) = 0\}$.
