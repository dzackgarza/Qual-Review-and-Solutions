## 1
Let $G$ be a finite group and $s, t\in G$ be two distinct elements of order 2.
Show that subgroup of $G$ generated by $s$ and $t$ is a dihedral group.

> Recall that the dihedral groups of order $2m$ for $m\geq 2$ are of the form
\begin{align*}
D_{2m} = \gens{\sigma, \tau \suchthat \sigma^m = 1 = \tau^2, \tau \sigma = \sigma\inv \tau}
.\end{align*}


## 2
Let $A, B$ be two $n\times n$ matrices with the property that $AB = BA$.
Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are diagonalizable.
Prove that $A$ and $B$ are *simultaneously* diagonalizable.


## 3
How many groups are there up to isomorphism of order $pq$ where $p<q$ are prime integers?


## 4

Set $f(x) = x^3 - 5 \in \QQ[x]$.

a. Find the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\QQ$.

b. Find the Galois group $G$ of $K$ over $\QQ$.

c. Exhibit explicitly the correspondence between subgroups of $G$ and intermediate fields between $\QQ$ and $K$.


## 5

How many monic irreducible polynomials over $\FF_p$ of prime degree $\ell$ are there?
Justify your answer.


## 6
Let $R$ be a ring and $f: M\to N$ and $g: N\to M$ be $R\dash$module homomorphisms such that $g\circ f = \id_M$.
Show that $N\cong \im f \oplus \ker g$.




## 7

a. Define what it means for a group $G$ to be *solvable*.

b. Show that every group $G$ of order 36 is solvable.

  > Hint: you can use that $S_4$ is solvable.
