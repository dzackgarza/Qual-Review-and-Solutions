# Ring Theory

## Spring 2021 #5 $\work$

Suppose that $f(x) \in (\ZZ/n\ZZ)[x]$ is a zero divisor.
Show that there is a nonzero $a\in \ZZ/n\ZZ$ with $af(x) = 0$.

a. Carefully state the definition of **Noetherian** for a commutative ring $R$.

b. Let $R$ be a subset of $\ZZ[x]$ consisting of all polynomials 
\[
f(x) = a_ 0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_nx^n
\]
such that $a_k$ is even for $1\leq k \leq n$.
Show that $R$ is a subring of $\ZZ[x]$.

c. Show that $R$ is not Noetherian.

  *Hint: consider the ideal generated by \( \ts{ 2x^k \st 1\leq k \in \ZZ } \).*
