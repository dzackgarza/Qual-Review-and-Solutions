## 1
Let
\begin{align*}
A=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
-3 & 3 & -2 \\
-7 & 6 & -3 \\
1 & -1 & 2
\end{array}\right) \in M_{3}(\mathrm{C})
.\end{align*}

a. Find the Jordan canonical form $J$ of $A$.

b. Find an invertible matrix $P$ such that $P\inv A P = J$.
  You do not need to compute $P\inv$.

## 2

Let $K = \QQ[\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 5]$.

a. Find $[K: \QQ]$.

b. Show that $K/\QQ$ is Galois, and find the Galois group $G$ of $K/\QQ$.

c. Exhibit explicitly the correspondence between subgroups of $G$ and intermediate fields between $\QQ$ and $K$.



## 3

a. State the three Sylow theorems.

b. Prove that any group of order 1225 is abelian.

c. Write down exactly one representative in each isomorphism class of abelian groups of order 1225.


## 4

Let $R$ be a ring with the following commutative diagram of $R\dash$modules, where each row represents a short exact sequence of $R\dash$modules:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & A \ar[d, "\alpha"] \ar[r, "f"] & B \ar[d, "\beta"] \ar[r, "g"] & C \ar[r] \ar[d, "\gamma"] & 0 \\
0 \ar[r] & A' \ar[r, "f'"] & B'\ar[r, "g'"] & C' \ar[r] & 0 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Prove that if $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are isomorphisms then $\beta$ is an isomorphism.

## 5

Let $G$ be a finite group acting on a set $X$.
For $x\in X$, let $G_x$ be the stabilizer of $x$ and $G\cdot x$ be the orbit of $x$.

a. Prove that there is a bijection between the left cosets $G/G_x$ and $G\cdot x$.

b. Prove that the center of every finite $p\dash$group $G$ is nontrivial by considering that action of $G$ on $X=G$ by conjugation.


## 6

Let $K$ be a Galois extension of a field $F$ with $[K: F] = 2015$.
Prove that $K$ is an extension by radicals of the field $F$.

## 7

Let $D = \QQ[x]$ and let $M$ be a $\QQ[x]\dash$module such that
\begin{align*}
M \cong \frac{\mathbb{Q}[x]}{(x-1)^{3}} \oplus \frac{\mathbb{Q}[x]}{\left(x^{2}+1\right)^{3}} \oplus \frac{\mathbb{Q}[x]}{(x-1)\left(x^{2}+1\right)^{5}} \oplus \frac{\mathbb{Q}[x]}{(x+2)\left(x^{2}+1\right)^{2}}
.\end{align*}

Determine the elementary divisors and invariant factors of $M$.


## 8

Let $R$ be a simple rng (a nonzero ring which is not assume to have a 1, whose only two-sided ideals are $(0)$ and $R$) satisfying the following two conditions:

i. $R$ has no zero divisors, and
ii. If $x\in R$ with $x\neq 0$ then $2x\neq 0$, where $2x\definedas x+x$.

Prove the following:

a. For each $x\in R$ there is one and only one element $y\in R$ such that $x = 2y$.
b. Suppose $x,y\in R$ such that $x\neq 0$ and $2(xy) = x$, then $yz = zy$ for all $z\in R$.

> You can get partial credit for (b) by showing it in the case $R$ has a 1.
