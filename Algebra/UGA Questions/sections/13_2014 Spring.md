## 1
Let $p, n$ be integers such that $p$ is prime and $p$ does not divide $n$.
Find a real number $k = k (p, n)$ such that for every integer $m\geq k$, every group of order $p^m n$ is not simple.


## 2
Let $G\subset S_9$ be a Sylow-3 subgroup of the symmetric group on 9 letters.

a. Show that $G$ contains a subgroup $H$ isomorphic to $\ZZ_3 \cross \ZZ_3 \cross \ZZ_3$ by exhibiting an appropriate set of cycles.

b. Show that $H$ is normal in $G$.

c. Give generators and relations for $G$ as an abstract group, such that all generators have order 3.
  Also exhibit elements of $S_9$ in cycle notation corresponding to these generators.

d. Without appealing to the previous parts of the problem, show that $G$ contains an element of order 9.


## 3
Let $F\subset C$ be a field extension with $C$ algebraically closed.

a. Prove that the intermediate field $C_{\text{alg}} \subset C$ consisting of elements algebraic over $F$ is algebraically closed.

b. Prove that if $F\to E$ is an algebraic extension, there exists a homomorphism $E\to C$ that is the identity on $F$.


## 4
Let $E\subset \CC$ denote the splitting field over $\QQ$ of the polynomial $x^3 - 11$.

a. Prove that if $n$ is a squarefree positive integer, then $\sqrt{n}\not\in E$.

  > Hint: you can describe all quadratic extensions of $\QQ$ contained in $E$.

b. Find the Galois group of $(x^3 - 11)(x^2 - 2)$ over $\QQ$.

c. Prove that the minimal polynomial of $11^{1/3} + 2^{1/2}$ over $\QQ$ has degree 6.


## 5

Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $a\in R$.
Prove that $a$ is not nilpotent $\iff$ there exists a commutative ring $S$ and a ring homomorphism $\phi: R\to S$ such that $\phi(a)$ is a unit.

> Note: by definition, $a$ is nilpotent $\iff$ there is a natural number $n$ such that $a^n = 0$.


## 6
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and let $n$ be a positive integer.

a. Prove that every surjective $R\dash$linear endomorphism $T: R^n \to R^n$ is injective.

b. Show that an injective $R\dash$linear endomorphism of $R^n$ need not be surjective.


## 7
Let $G = \GL(3, \QQ[x])$ be the group of invertible $3\times 3$ matrices over $\QQ[x]$.
For each $f\in \QQ[x]$, let $S_f$ be the set of $3\times 3$ matrices $A$ over $\QQ[x]$ such that $\det(A) = c f(x)$ for some nonzero constant $c\in \QQ$.

a. Show that for $(P, Q) \in G\cross G$ and $A\in S_f$, the formula
  \begin{align*}
  (P, Q)\cdot A \definedas PAQ\inv
  \end{align*}
  gives a well defined map $G\cross G \cross S_f \to S_f$ and show that this map gives a group action of $G\cross G$ on $S_f$.

b. For $f(x) = x^3(x^2+1)^2$, give one representative from each orbit of the group action in (a), and justify your assertion.
