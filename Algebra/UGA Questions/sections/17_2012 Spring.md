b. Show that $E\neq \QQ(\alpha)$.


## 5

b. Show that $M/M_t$ is torsion free.

c. Prove that $M \cong M_t \oplus F$ where $F$ is a free module.


## 6
Let $k$ be a field and let the group $G = \GL(m, k) \cross \GL(n, k)$ acts on the set of $m\times n$ matrices $M_{m, n}(k)$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
(A, B) \cdot X = AXB\inv
\end{align*}
where $(A, B) \in G$ and $X\in M_{m, n}(k)$.

a. State what it means for a group to act on a set.
  Prove that the above definition yields a group action.

b. Exhibit with justification a subset $S$ of $M_{m, n}(k)$ which contains precisely one element of each orbit under this action.


## 7
Consider the following matrix as a linear transformation from $V\definedas \CC^5$ to itself:
\begin{align*}
A=\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-4 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2
\end{array}\right)
.\end{align*}

a. Find the invariant factors of $A$.

b. Express $V$ in terms of a direct sum of indecomposable $\CC[x]\dash$modules.

c. Find the Jordan canonical form of $A$.

## 8

b. Define the *characteristic polynomial* for $T$.

c. Prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem: the linear transformation $T$ satisfies its characteristic polynomial.
