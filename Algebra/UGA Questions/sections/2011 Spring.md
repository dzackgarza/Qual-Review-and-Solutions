Suppose that $F\subset E$ are fields such that $E/F$ is Galois and $\abs{\gal(E/F)} = 14$.

a. Show that there exists a unique intermediate field $K$ with $F\subset K \subset E$ such that $[K: F] = 2$.

b. Assume that there are at least two distinct intermediate subfields $F \subset L_1, L_2 \subset E$ with $[L_i: F]= 7$.
  Prove that $\gal(E/F)$ is nonabelian.


## 2
Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime number such that there is a normal subgroup $H\normal G$ with $\abs{H} = p^i > 1$.

a. Show that $H$ is a subgroup of any Sylow $p\dash$subgroup of $G$.

b. Show that $G$ contains a nonzero abelian normal subgroup of order divisible by $p$.
