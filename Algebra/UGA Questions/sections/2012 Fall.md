Let $G$ be a finite group and $X$ a set on which $G$ acts.

a. Let $x\in X$ and $G_x \definedas \theset{g\in G \suchthat g\cdot x = x}$. 
  Show that $G_x$ is a subgroup of $G$.

b. Let $x\in X$ and $G\cdot x \definedas \theset{g\cdot x \suchthat g\in G}$.
  Prove that there is a bijection between elements in $G\cdot x$ and the left cosets of $G_x$ in $G$.


## 2
Let $G$ be a group of order 30.

a. Show that $G$ contains normal subgroups of orders 3, 5, and 15.

b. Give all possible presentations and relations for $G$.

c. Determine how many groups of order 30 there are up to isomorphism.
