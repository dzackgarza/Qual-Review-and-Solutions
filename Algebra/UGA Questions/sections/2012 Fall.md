## 1
Let $G$ be a finite group and $X$ a set on which $G$ acts.

a. Let $x\in X$ and $G_x \definedas \theset{g\in G \suchthat g\cdot x = x}$. 
  Show that $G_x$ is a subgroup of $G$.

b. Let $x\in X$ and $G\cdot x \definedas \theset{g\cdot x \suchthat g\in G}$.
  Prove that there is a bijection between elements in $G\cdot x$ and the left cosets of $G_x$ in $G$.


## 2
Let $G$ be a group of order 30.

a. Show that $G$ contains normal subgroups of orders 3, 5, and 15.

b. Give all possible presentations and relations for $G$.

c. Determine how many groups of order 30 there are up to isomorphism.


## 3
Let $f(x) \in \QQ[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree 5.
Assume that $f$ has all be two roots in $\RR$.
Compute the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\QQ$ and justify your answer.


## 4
Let $f(x) \in \QQ[x]$ be a polynomial and $K$ be a splitting field of $f$ over $\QQ$.
Assume that $[K:\QQ] = 1225$ and show that $f(x)$ is solvable by radicals.


## 5
Let $U$ be an infinite-dimensional vector space over a field $k$, $f: U\to U$ a linear map, and $\theset{u_1, \cdots, u_m} \subset U$ vectors such that $U$ is generated by $\theset{u_1, \cdots, u_m, f^d(u_1), \cdots, d^d(u_m)}$.
