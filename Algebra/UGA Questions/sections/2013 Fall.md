## 1
Let $p, q$ be distinct primes.

a. Let $\bar q \in \ZZ_p$ be the class of $q\mod p$ and let $k$ denote the order of $\bar q$ as an element of $\ZZ_p\units$.
  Prove that no group of order $pq^k$ is simple.

b. Let $G$ be a group of order $pq$, and prove that $G$ is not simple.


## 2
Let $G$ be a group of order 30.

a. Show that $G$ has a subgroup of order 15.

b. Show that every group of order 15 is cyclic.

c. Show that $G$ is isomorphic to some semidirect product $\ZZ_{15} \semidirect \ZZ_2$.

d. Exhibit three nonisomorphic groups of order 30 and prove that they are not isomorphic.
  You are not required to use your answer to (c).


## 3

a. Define *prime ideal*, give an example of a nontrivial ideal in the ring $\ZZ$ that is not prime, and prove that it is not prime.

b. Define *maximal ideal*, give an example of a nontrivial maximal ideal in $\ZZ$ and prove that it is maximal.
