Let $R$ be a commutative ring.

a. Define a *maximal ideal* and prove that $R$ has a maximal ideal.

b. Show than an element $r\in R$ is not invertible $\iff r$ is contained in a maximal ideal.

c. Let $M$ be an $R\dash$module, and recall that for $0\neq \mu \in M$, the *annihilator* of $\mu$ is the set
  \begin{align*}
  \ann(\mu) = \theset{r\in R \suchthat r\mu = 0}
  .\end{align*}
  Suppose that $I$ is an ideal in $R$ which is maximal with respect to the property that there exists an element $\mu \in M$ such that $I = \ann(\mu)$ for some $\mu \in M$.
  In other words, $I = \ann(\mu)$ but there does not exist $\nu\in M$ with $J = \ann(\nu) \subsetneq R$ such that $I\subsetneq J$.

  Prove that $I$ is a prime ideal.
