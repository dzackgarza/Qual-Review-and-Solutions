## 1
Let $G$ be a group containing a subgroup $H$ not equal to $G$ of finite index.
Prove that $G$ has a normal subgroup which is contained in every conjugate of $H$ which is of finite index.

## 2
Let $G$ be a finite group, $H$ a $p\dash$subgroup, and $P$ a sylow $p\dash$subgroup for $p$ a prime.
Let $H$ act on the left cosets of $P$ in $G$ by left translation.

Prove that this is an orbit under this action of length 1.

Prove that $xP$ is an orbit of length 1 $\iff H$ is contained in $xPx\inv$.
