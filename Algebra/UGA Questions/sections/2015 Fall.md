## 1
Let $G$ be a group containing a subgroup $H$ not equal to $G$ of finite index.
Prove that $G$ has a normal subgroup which is contained in every conjugate of $H$ which is of finite index.

## 2
Let $G$ be a finite group, $H$ a $p\dash$subgroup, and $P$ a sylow $p\dash$subgroup for $p$ a prime.
Let $H$ act on the left cosets of $P$ in $G$ by left translation.

Prove that this is an orbit under this action of length 1.

Prove that $xP$ is an orbit of length 1 $\iff H$ is contained in $xPx\inv$.


## 3

Let $R$ be a rng (a ring without 1) which contains an element $u$ such that for all $y\in R$, there exists an $x\in R$ such that $xu=y$.

Prove that $R$ contains a maximal left ideal.

> Hint: imitate the proof (using Zorn's lemma) in the case where $R$ does have a 1.


## 4

Let $R$ be a PID and $(a_1) < (a_2) < \cdots$ be an ascending chain of ideals in $R$.
Prove that for some $n$, we have $(a_j) = (a_n)$ for all $j\geq n$.


## 5

Let $u = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}$, $v = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}$, and $E = \QQ(u)$.

a. Find (with justification) the minimal polynomial $f(x)$ of $u$ over $\QQ$.

b. Show $v\in E$, and show that $E$ is a splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\QQ$.

c. Determine the Galois group of $E$ over $\QQ$ and determine all of the intermediate fields $F$ such that $\QQ \subset F \subset E$.
