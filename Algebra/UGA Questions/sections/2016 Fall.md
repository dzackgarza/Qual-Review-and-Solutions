Let $G$ be a finite group and $s, t\in G$ be two distinct elements of order 2.
Show that subgroup of $G$ generated by $s$ and $t$ is a dihedral group.

> Recall that the dihedral groups of order $2m$ for $m\geq 2$ are of the form
\begin{align*}
D_{2m} = \gens{\sigma, \tau \suchthat \sigma^m = 1 = \tau^2, \tau \sigma = \sigma\inv \tau}
.\end{align*}
