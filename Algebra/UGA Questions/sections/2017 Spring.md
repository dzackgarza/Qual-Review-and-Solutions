## 1

Let $G$ be a finite group and $\pi: G\to \sym(G)$ the Cayley representation.
(Recall that this means that for an element $x\in G$, $\pi(x)$ acts by left translation on $G$.)

Prove that $\pi(x)$ is an odd permutation $\iff$ the order $\abs{\pi(x)}$ of $\pi(x)$ is even and $\abs{G} / \abs{\pi(x)}$ is odd.

## 2

a. How many isomorphism classes of abelian groups of order 56 are there?
  Give a representative for one of each class.

b. Prove that if $G$ is a group of order 56, then either the Sylow-2 subgroup or the Sylow-7 subgroup is normal.

c. Give two non-isomorphic groups of order 56 where the Sylow-7 subgroup is normal and the Sylow-2 subgroup is *not* normal.
  Justify that these two groups are not isomorphic.


## 3

Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1.
Suppose that $M$ is a free $R\dash$module with a finite basis $X$.

a. Let $I \normal R$ be a proper ideal.
  Prove that $M/IM$ is a free $R/I\dash$module with basis $X'$, where $X'$ is the image of $X$ under the canonical map $M\to M/IM$.

b. Prove that any two bases of $M$ have the same number of elements.
  You may assume that the result is true when $R$ is a field.

## 4

a. Let $R$ be an integral domain with quotient field $F$.
  Suppose that $p(x), a(x), b(x)$ are monic polynomials in $F[x]$ with $p(x) = a(x) b(x)$ and with $p(x) \in R[x]$, $a(x)$ not in $R[x]$, and both $a(x), b(x)$ not constant.
  Prove that $R$ is not a UFD.
  (You may assume Gauss' lemma)

b. Prove that $\ZZ[2\sqrt{2}]$ is not a UFD.

  > Hint: let $p(x) = x^2-2$.

## 5

Let $R$ be an integral domain and let $M$ be a nonzero torsion $R\dash$module.

a. Prove that if $M$ is finitely generated then the annihilator in $R$ of $M$ is nonzero.

b. Give an example of a non-finitely generated torsion $R\dash$module whose annihilator is $(0)$, and justify your answer.

## 6

Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with all entries equal to $0$ except for the $n-1$ entries just above the diagonal being equal to 2.

a. What is the Jordan canonical form of $A$, viewed as a matrix in $M_n(\CC)$?

b. Find a nonzero matrix $P\in M_n(\CC)$ such that $P\inv A P$ is in Jordan canonical form.

## 7 

Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x) \in F[x]$.

a. Define what a splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$ is.

b. Let $F$ now be a finite field with $q$ elements.
  Let $E/F$ be a finite extension of degree $n>0$.
  Exhibit an explicit polynomial $g(x) \in F[x]$ such that $E/F$ is a splitting field of $g(x)$ over $F$.
  Fully justify your answer.

c. Show that the extension $E/F$ in (b) is a Galois extension.

## 8

a. Let $K$ denote the splitting field of $x^5 - 2$ over $\QQ$.
  Show that the Galois group of $K/\QQ$ is isomorphic to the group of invertible matrices

  \begin{align*}
  \left(\begin{array}{ll}
  a & b \\
  0 & 1
  \end{array}\right) 
  \qtext{where} a\in \FF_5\units \text{ and } b\in \FF_5
  .\end{align*}

b. Determine all intermediate fields between $K$ and $\QQ$ which are Galois over $\QQ$.
