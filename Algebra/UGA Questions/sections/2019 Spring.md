## 1.

Let $A$ be a square matrix over the complex numbers.
Suppose that $A$ is nonsingular
and that $A^{2019}$ is diagonalizable over $\CC$.

Show that $A$ is also diagonalizable over $\CC$.

## 2.
Let $F = \FF_p$ , where $p$ is a prime number.

(a) Show that if $\pi(x) \in F[x]$ is irreducible of degree $d$, then $\pi(x)$ divides $x^{p^d} - x$.


(b) Show that if $\pi(x) \in F[x]$ is an irreducible polynomial that divides $x^{p^n} - x$,
then $\deg \pi(x)$ divides $n$.

## 3.

How many isomorphism classes are there of groups of order 45?

Describe a representative from each class.

## 4.

For a finite group $G$, let $c(G)$ denote the number of conjugacy classes of $G$.

(a) Prove that if two elements of $G$ are chosen uniformly at random,then the probability they commute is precisely
$$
\frac{c(G)}{\abs G}
.$$

(b) State the class equation for a finite group.

(c) Using the class equation (or otherwise) show that the probability in part (a) is at most $$
\frac 1 2 + \frac 1 {2[G : Z(G)]}
.$$

> Here, as usual, $Z(G)$ denotes the center of $G$.

## 5.

Let $R$ be an integral domain. Recall that if $M$ is an $R\dash$module, the *rank* of $M$ is
defined to be the maximum number of $R\dash$linearly independent elements of $M$ .

(a) Prove that for any $R\dash$module $M$, the rank of $\tor(M )$ is 0.

(b) Prove that the rank of $M$ is equal to the rank of of $M/\tor(M )$.

(c) Suppose that M is a non-principal ideal of $R$.

    Prove that $M$ is torsion-free of rank 1 but not free.

## 6.

Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1.

> Recall that $x \in R$ is nilpotent iff $xn = 0$ for
some positive integer $n$.

(a) Show that every proper ideal of $R$ is contained within a maximal ideal.

(b) Let $J(R)$ denote the intersection of all maximal ideals of $R$.

    Show that $x \in J(R) \iff 1 + rx$ is a unit for all $r \in R$.

(c) Suppose now that $R$ is finite. Show that in this case $J(R)$ consists precisely
of the nilpotent elements in R.

## 7.

Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $A$ be a $p \times p$ matrix over a field $F$ with 1 in all
entries except 0 on the main diagonal.

Determine the Jordan canonical form (JCF) of $A$

(a) When $F = \QQ$,

(b) When $F = \FF_p$.

> Hint: In both cases, all eigenvalues lie in the ground field. In each case find a
matrix $P$ such that $P\inv AP$ is in JCF.

## 8.
Let $\zeta = e^{2\pi i/8}$.

(a) What is the degree of $\QQ(\zeta)/\QQ$?

(b) How many quadratic subfields of $\QQ(\zeta)$ are there?

(c) What is the degree of $\QQ(\zeta, \sqrt[4] 2)$ over $\QQ$?
