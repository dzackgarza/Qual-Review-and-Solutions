# Spring 2020

## 1

a. Show that any group of order 2020 is solvable.

b. Give (without proof) a classification of all abelian groups of order 2020.

c. Describe one nonabelian group of order 2020.

## 2

Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of a finite group $G$ where the order of $H$ and the index of $H$ in $G$ are relatively prime.
Prove that no other subgroup of $G$ has the same order as $H$.

## 3

Let $E$ be an extension field of $F$ and $\alpha\in E$ be algebraic of odd degree over $F$.

a. Show that $F(\alpha) = F(\alpha^2)$.

b. Prove that $\alpha^{2020}$ is algebraic of odd degree over $F$.

## 4

Let $f(x) = x^4-2 \in \QQ[x]$.

a. Define what it means for a finite extension field $E$ of a field $F$ to be a Galois extension.

b. Determine the Galois group $\gal(E/\QQ)$ for the polynomial $f(x)$, and justify your answer carefully.

c. Exhibit a subfield $K$ in $(b)$ such that $\QQ \leq K \leq E$ with $K$ not a Galois extension over $\QQ$. Explain.

## 5

Let $R$ be a ring and $f: M\to N$ and $g: N\to M$ be $R\dash$module homomorphisms such that $g\circ f = \id_M$.
Show that $N \cong \im f \oplus \ker g$.

## 6

Let $R$ be a ring with unity.

a. Give a definition for a free module over $R$.

b. Define what it means for an $R\dash$module to be torsion free.

c. Prove that if $F$ is a free module, then any short exact sequence of $R\dash$modules of the following form splits:
\begin{align*}
0 \to N \to M \to F \to 0
.\end{align*}

d. Let $R$ be a PID. 
  Show that any finitely generated $R\dash$module $M$ can be expressed as a direct sum of a torsion module and a free module.
  You may assume that a finitely generated torsion module over a PID is free.

## 7

Let
\begin{align*}
A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 0 & 0 \\
4 & 6 & 1 \\
-16 & -16 & -2
\end{array}\right] \in M_{3}(\mathrm{C})
.\end{align*}

a. Find the Jordan canonical form $J$ of $A$.

b. Find an invertible matrix $P$ such that $P\inv A P = J$. 
  You should not need to compute $P\inv$.

c. Write down the minimal polynomial of $A$.

## 8

Let $T:V\to V$ be a linear transformation where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $\CC$.
Prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem: if $p(x)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $T$, then $p(T) = 0$.
You may use canonical forms.
