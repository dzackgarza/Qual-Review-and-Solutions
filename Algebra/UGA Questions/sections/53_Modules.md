## General Questions

### Fall 2019 Final #2 
Consider the $\ZZ\dash$submodule $N$ of $\ZZ^3$ spanned by $f_1 = [-1, 0, 1], f_2 = [2,-3,1], f_3 = [0, 3, 1], f_4 = [3,1,5]$. Find a basis for $N$ and describe $\ZZ^3/N$.

### Spring 2018 #6.

Let
$$
M = \{(w, x, y, z) \in \ZZ^4 \suchthat w + x + y + z \in 2\ZZ\}
,$$

and

$$
N = \{(w, x, y, z) \in \ZZ^4 \suchthat 4\divides (w - x),~ 4\divides (x - y),~ 4\divides ( y - z)\}
.$$

(a) Show that $N$ is a $\ZZ\dash$submodule of $M$ .

(b) Find vectors $u_1 , u_2 , u_3 , u_4 \in \ZZ^4$ and integers $d_1 , d_2 , d_3 , d_4$ such that
$$
\{u_1 , u_2 , u_3 , u_4 \}
$$
is a free basis for $M$, and
$$
\{d_1 u_1,~ d_2 u_2,~ d_3 u_3,~ d_4 u_4 \}
$$
is a free basis for $N$ .

(c) Use the previous part to describe $M/N$ as a direct sum of cyclic $\ZZ\dash$modules.

### Fall 2018 #6 $\bowtie$

Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $M$ be an $R\dash$module. 
An $R\dash$submodule $N$ of $M$ is maximal if there is no $R\dash$module $P$ with $N \subsetneq P \subsetneq M$.

(a) Show that an $R\dash$submodule $N$ of $M$ is maximal $\iff M /N$ is a simple $R\dash$module: i.e., $M /N$ is nonzero and has no proper, nonzero $R\dash$submodules.

(b) Let $M$ be a $\ZZ\dash$module. Show that a $\ZZ\dash$submodule $N$ of $M$ is maximal $\iff \#M /N$ is a prime number.

(c) Let $M$ be the $\ZZ\dash$module of all roots of unity in $\CC$ under multiplication.
Show that there is no maximal $\ZZ\dash$submodule of $M$.
