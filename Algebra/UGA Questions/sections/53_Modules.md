### Fall 2019 Final #2 
Consider the $\ZZ\dash$submodule $N$ of $\ZZ^3$ spanned by $f_1 = [-1, 0, 1], f_2 = [2,-3,1], f_3 = [0, 3, 1], f_4 = [3,1,5]$. Find a basis for $N$ and describe $\ZZ^3/N$.

### Spring 2018 #6.

Let
$$
M = \{(w, x, y, z) \in \ZZ^4 \suchthat w + x + y + z \in 2\ZZ\}
,$$

and

$$
N = \{(w, x, y, z) \in \ZZ^4 \suchthat 4\divides (w - x),~ 4\divides (x - y),~ 4\divides ( y - z)\}
.$$

a. Show that $N$ is a $\ZZ\dash$submodule of $M$ .

b. Find vectors $u_1 , u_2 , u_3 , u_4 \in \ZZ^4$ and integers $d_1 , d_2 , d_3 , d_4$ such that
$$
\{u_1 , u_2 , u_3 , u_4 \}
$$
is a free basis for $M$, and
$$
\{d_1 u_1,~ d_2 u_2,~ d_3 u_3,~ d_4 u_4 \}
$$
is a free basis for $N$ .

c. Use the previous part to describe $M/N$ as a direct sum of cyclic $\ZZ\dash$modules.

### Fall 2018 #6 $\bowtie$

Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $M$ be an $R\dash$module. 
An $R\dash$submodule $N$ of $M$ is maximal if there is no $R\dash$module $P$ with $N \subsetneq P \subsetneq M$.

a. Show that an $R\dash$submodule $N$ of $M$ is maximal $\iff M /N$ is a simple $R\dash$module: i.e., $M /N$ is nonzero and has no proper, nonzero $R\dash$submodules.

b. Let $M$ be a $\ZZ\dash$module. Show that a $\ZZ\dash$submodule $N$ of $M$ is maximal $\iff \#M /N$ is a prime number.

c. Let $M$ be the $\ZZ\dash$module of all roots of unity in $\CC$ under multiplication.
Show that there is no maximal $\ZZ\dash$submodule of $M$.

a

By the correspondence theorem, submodules of $M/N$ biject with submodules $A$ of $M$ containing $N$.

So 

- $M$ is maximal:

- $\iff$ no such (proper, nontrivial) submodule $A$ exists 

- $\iff$ there are no (proper, nontrivial) submodules of $M/N$ 

- $\iff M/N$ is simple.

b

Identify $\ZZ\dash$modules with abelian groups, then by (a), $N$ is maximal $\iff$ $M/N$ is simple $\iff$ $M/N$ has no nontrivial proper subgroups.

By Cauchy's theorem, if $\abs{M/N} = ab$ is a composite number, then $a\divides ab \implies$ there is an element (and thus a subgroup) of order $a$.
In this case, $M/N$ contains a nontrivial proper cyclic subgroup, so $M/N$ is not simple.
So $\abs{M/N}$ can not be composite, and therefore must be prime.

c

Let $G = \theset{x \in \CC \suchthat x^n=1 \text{ for some }n\in \NN}$, and suppose $H < G$ is a proper subgroup.

Then there must be a prime $p$ such that the $\zeta_{p^k} \not \in H$ for all $k$ greater than some constant $m$ -- otherwise, we can use the fact that if $\zeta_{p^k} \in H$ then $\zeta_{p^\ell} \in H$ for all $\ell \leq k$, and if $\zeta_{p^k} \in H$ for all $p$ and all $k$ then $H = G$.

But this means there are infinitely many elements in $G\setminus H$, and so $\infty = [G: H] = \abs{G/H}$ is not a prime. 
Thus by (b), $H$ can not be maximal, a contradiction.

### Spring 2018 #7.

Let $R$ be a PID and $M$ be an $R\dash$module. Let $p$ be a prime element of $R$. The module $M$ is called *$\generators{p}\dash$primary* if for every $m \in M$ there exists $k > 0$ such that $p^k m = 0$.

a. Suppose M is $\generators{p}\dash$primary. Show that if $m \in M$ and $t \in R, ~t \not\in \generators{p}$, then there exists $a \in R$ such that
$atm = m$.

b. A submodule $S$ of $M$ is said to be *pure* if $S \cap r M = rS$ for all $r \in R$. Show that if $M$ is $\generators{p}\dash$primary, then $S$ is pure if and only if $S \cap p^k M = p^k S$ for all $k \geq 0$.
