Let $G = \GL(3, \QQ[x])$ be the group of invertible $3\times 3$ matrices over $\QQ[x]$.
For each $f\in \QQ[x]$, let $S_f$ be the set of $3\times 3$ matrices $A$ over $\QQ[x]$ such that $\det(A) = c f(x)$ for some nonzero constant $c\in \QQ$.

a. Show that for $(P, Q) \in G\cross G$ and $A\in S_f$, the formula
  \[
  (P, Q)\cdot A \definedas PAQ\inv
  \]
  gives a well defined map $G\cross G \cross S_f \to S_f$ and show that this map gives a group action of $G\cross G$ on $S_f$.

b. For $f(x) = x^3(x^2+1)^2$, give one representative from each orbit of the group action in (a), and justify your assertion.

Let $F$ be a field and $T$ an $n\times n$ matrix with entries in $F$.
Let $I$ be the ideal consisting of all polynomials $f\in F[x]$ such that $f(T) =0$.

Show that the following statements are equivalent about a polynomial $g\in I$:

a. $g$ is irreducible.

b. If $k\in F[x]$ is nonzero and of degree strictly less than $g$, then $k[T]$ is an invertible matrix.

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ and $V\dual$ its dual.
A *symmetric bilinear form* $(\wait, \wait)$ on $V$ is a map $V\cross V\to F$ satisfying
\[
(av_1 + b v_2, w) = a(v_1, w) + b(v_2, w) \qtext{and} (v_1, v_2) = (v_2, v_1)
\]
for all $a, b\in F$ and $v_1, v_2 \in V$.
The form is *nondegenerate* if the only element $w\in V$ satisfying $(v, w) = 0$ for all $v\in V$ is $w=0$.

Suppose $(\wait, \wait)$ is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on $V$.
If $W$ is a subspace of $V$, define
\[
W\perp \definedas \theset{v\in V \suchthat (v, w) = 0 \text{ for all } w\in W}
.\]

a. Show that if $X, Y$ are subspaces of $V$ with $Y\subset X$, then $X\perp \subseteq Y\perp$.

b. Define an injective linear map 
  \[
  \psi: Y\perp/X\perp \injects (X/Y)\dual
  \]
  which is an isomorphism if $V$ is finite dimensional.
