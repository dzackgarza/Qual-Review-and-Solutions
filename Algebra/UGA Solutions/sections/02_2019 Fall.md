> Theorem: $F\units$ is always cyclic for $F$ a field

### a

Since $\abs{F} = q$ and $[E:F] = k$, we have $\abs{E} = q^k$ and $\abs{E\units} = q^k-1$.
Noting that $\zeta \in E\units$ we must have $n = o(\zeta) \divides \abs{E\units} = q^k-1$ by Lagrange's theorem.

### b

Rephrasing (a), we have 
\[
n \divides q^k-1 
&\iff q^k-1 \cong 0 \mod n \\
&\iff q^k \cong 1 \mod n \\
&\iff m \definedas o(q) \divides k
.\]

### c

Since $m\divides k \iff k = \ell m$, (**claim**) there is an intermediate subfield $M$ such that
\[
E \leq M \leq F \quad k = [F:E] = [F:M] [M:E] = \ell m
,\]

so $M$ is a degree $m$ extension of $E$.

Now consider $M\units$. 
By the argument in (a), $n$ divides $q^m - 1 = \abs{M\units}$, and $M\units$ is cyclic, so it contains a cyclic subgroup $H$ of order $n$.

But then $x\in H \implies p(x)\definedas x^n-1 = 0$, and since $p(x)$ has at most $n$ roots in a field. 
So $H = \theset{x \in M \suchthat x^n-1 = 0}$, i.e. $H$ contains all solutions to $x^n-1$ in $E[x]$.

But $\zeta$ is one such solution, so $\zeta \in H \subset M\units \subset M$.
Since $F[\zeta]$ is the smallest field extension containing $\zeta$, we must have $F = M$, so $\ell = 1$, and $k = m$.

> One-step submodule test.

### a

It suffices to show that 
$$
r\in R, ~t_1, t_2\in \Tor(M) \implies rt_1 + t_2 \in \Tor(M)
.$$

We have
\[
t_1 \in \Tor(M) &\implies \exists s_1 \neq 0 \text{ such that } s_1 t_1  = 0 \\
t_2 \in \Tor(M) &\implies \exists s_2 \neq 0 \text{ such that } s_2 t_2  = 0 
.\]

Since $R$ is an integral domain, $s_1 s_2 \neq 0$.
Then
\[
s_1 s_2(rt_1 + t_2) 
&= s_1 s_2 r t_1 + s_1 s_2t_2 \\
&= s_2 r (s_1 t_1) + s_1 (s_2 t_2)  \quad\text{since $R$ is commutative} \\
&=  s_2 r(0) + s_1(0) \\
&= 0
.\]

### b

Let $R = \ZZ/6\ZZ$ as a $\ZZ/6\ZZ \dash$module, which is not an integral domain as a ring.

Then $[3]_6\actson [2]_6 = [0]_6$ and $[2]_6\actson [3]_6 = [0]_6$, but $[2]_6 + [3]_6 = [5]_6$, where 5 is coprime to 6, and thus $[n]_6\actson [5]_6 = [0] \implies [n]_6 = [0]_6$. So $[5]_6$ is *not* a torsion element.

So the set of torsion elements are not closed under addition, and thus not a submodule.

### c

Suppose $R$ has zero divisors $a,b \neq 0$ where $ab = 0$.
Then for any $m\in M$, we have $b\actson m \definedas bm \in M$ as well, but then 
$$
a\actson bm = (ab)\actson m = 0\actson m = 0_M
,$$ 
so $m$ is a torsion element for any $m$.

$\qed$

### a

Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be prime and $x\in N$.
Then $x^k = 0 \in \mathfrak{p}$ for some $k$, and thus $x^k = x x^{k-1} \in \mathfrak p$.
Since $\mathfrak p$ is prime, inductively we obtain $x\in\mathfrak p$.

### b

Let $S = \theset{r^k \mid k\in \NN}$ be the set of positive powers of $r$. 
Then $S^2 \subseteq S$, since $r^{k_1}r^{k_2} = r^{k_1+k_2}$ is also a positive power of $r$, and $0\not\in S$ since $r\neq 0$ and $r\not\in N$.

By the corollary, $\theset{I \normal R \suchthat I\intersect S = \emptyset}$ has a maximal element $\mathfrak{p}$.

Since $R$ is commutative, $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime.

### c

Suppose $R$ has a unique prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$.

Suppose $r\in R$ is not a unit, and toward a contradiction, suppose that $r$ is also not nilpotent.

Since $r$ is not a unit, $r$ is contained in some maximal (and thus prime) ideal, and thus $r \in \mathfrak{p}$.

Since $r\not\in N$, by (b) there is a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ that avoids all positive powers of $r$. 
Since $\mathfrak{m}$ is prime, we must have $\mathfrak{m} = \mathfrak{p}$.
But then $r\not\in \mathfrak{p}$, a contradiction.

![](figures/2019-12-24-13-19-15.png)

Let $K = \QQ(\zeta)$. 
Then $K$ is the splitting field of $f(x) = x^n - 1$, which is irreducible over $\QQ$, so $K/\QQ$ is normal.
We also have $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ and $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ since they can not share any roots.

> Or equivalently, $f$ splits into distinct linear factors $f(x) = \prod_{k\leq n}(x-\zeta^k)$.

Since it is a Galois extension, $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = [K: \QQ] = \phi(n)$ for the totient function.

We can now define maps
\[
\tau_j: K &\to K \\
\zeta &\mapsto \zeta^j 
\]

and if we restrict to $j$ such that $\gcd(n, j) = 1$, this yields $\phi(n)$ maps.
Noting that if $\zeta$ is a primitive root, then $(n, j) = 1$ implies that that $\zeta^j$ is also a primitive root, and hence another root of $\min(\zeta, \QQ)$, and so these are in fact automorphisms of $K$ that fix $\QQ$ and thus elements of $\Gal(K/\QQ)$.

So define a map
\[
\theta: \ZZ_n\units &\to K \\
[j]_n &\mapsto \tau_j
.\]

from the *multiplicative* group of units to the Galois group.

The claim is that this is a surjective homomorphism, and since both groups are the same size, an isomorphism.

**Surjectivity:**

Letting $\sigma \in K$ be arbitrary, noting that $[K: \QQ]$ has a basis $\theset{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}}$, it suffices to specify $\sigma(\zeta)$ to fully determine the automorphism.
(Since $\sigma(\zeta^k) = \sigma(\zeta)^k$.)

In particular, $\sigma(\zeta)$ satisfies the polynomial $x^n - 1$, since $\sigma(\zeta)^n = \sigma(\zeta^n) = \sigma(1) = 1$, which means $\sigma(\zeta)$ is another root of unity and $\sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^k$ for some $1\leq k \leq n$.

Moreover, since $o(\zeta) = n \in K\units$, we must have $o(\zeta^k) = n \in K\units$ as well. Noting that $\theset{\zeta^i}$ forms a cyclic subgroup $H\leq K\units$, then $o(\zeta^k) = n \iff (n, k) = 1$ (by general theory of cyclic groups).

Thus $\theta$ is surjective.

**Homomorphism:**

\[
\tau_j \circ \tau_k (\zeta) =\tau_j(\zeta^k) = \zeta^{jk} \implies
\tau_{jk} = \theta(jk) = \tau_j \circ \tau_k
.\]

**Part 2:**

We have $K \cong \ZZ_{20}\units$ and $\phi(20) = 8$, so $K \cong \ZZ_8$, so we have the following subgroups and corresponding intermediate fields:

- $0 \sim \QQ(\zeta_{20})$
- $\ZZ_2 \sim \QQ(\omega_1)$
- $\ZZ_4 \sim \QQ(\omega_2)$
- $\ZZ_8 \sim \QQ$

For some elements $\omega_i$ which exist by the primitive element theorem.

### a.

Let $\vector v \in \Lambda$, so $\vector v = \sum_{i=1}^n r_i \vector e_i$ where $r_i \in \ZZ$ for all $i$.

Then if $\vector x = \sum_{j=1}^n s_j \vector e_j \in \Lambda$ is arbitrary, we have $s_j \in \ZZ$ for all $j$ and 
\[
\inner{\vector v}{\vector x} 
&= \inner{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \vector e_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n s_j \vector e_j } \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n r_i s_j \inner{\vector e_i}{\vector e_j }  \in \ZZ
\]

since this is a sum of products of integers (since $\inner{\vector e_i}{\vector e_j} \in \ZZ$ for each $i, j$ pair by assumption) so $\vector v \in \Lambda\dual$ by definition.

### b. 


**$\det M \neq 0$**:

Suppose $\det M = 0$. Then $\ker M \neq \vector 0$, so let $\vector v \in \ker M$ be given by $\vector v = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i \vector e_i \neq \vector 0$. 

Note that 
\[
M\vector v = 0 &\implies
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\vector e_1 \cdot \vector e_1 & \vector e_1 \cdot \vector e_2 & \cdots \\
\vector e_2 \cdot \vector e_1 & \vector e_2 \cdot \vector e_2 & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{array}
\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots
\end{array}\right] = \vector 0 \\ \\
&\implies \sum_{j=1}^n v_j\inner{\vector e_k}{\vector e_j} = 0 \qtext{for each fixed} k
.\]

We can now note that $\inner{\vector e_k}{\vector v} = \sum_{j=1}^n v_j \inner{\vector e_k}{\vector e_j} = 0$ for every $k$ by the above observation, which forces $\vector v = 0$ by non-degeneracy of $\inner{\wait}{\wait}$, a contradiction. 

$\qed$

*Alternative proof:*

Write $M = A^tA$ where $A$ has the $\vector e_i$ as columns. Then
\[
M\vector x = 0 
&\implies A^t A \vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \vector x^t A^t A \vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \norm{A \vector x}^2  = 0 \\
&\implies A\vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \vector x = 0
,\]

since $A$ has full rank because the $\vector e_i$ are linearly independent.

$\qed$

Let $A = [\vector e_1^t, \cdots, \vector e_n^t]$ be the matrix with $\vector e_i$ in the $i$th column.

**The rows of $A\inv$ span $\Lambda\dual$**:

Equivalently, the columns of $A^{-t}$ span $\Lambda\dual$.

Let $B = A^{-t}$ and let $\vector b_i$ denote the columns of $B$, so $\im B = \spanof{\theset{\vector b_i}}$.


Since $A \in \GL(n, \ZZ)$, $A\inv, A^t, A^{-t} \in \GL(n, \ZZ)$ as well.

\[
\vector v \in \Lambda\dual 
&\implies \inner{\vector e_i}{\vector v} = z_i \in \ZZ \quad \forall i \\
&\implies A^t \vector v = \vector z \definedas [z_1, \cdots, z_n] \in \ZZ^n \\
&\implies \vector v = A^{-t} \vector z \definedas B\vector z \in \im B \\
&\implies \vector v \in \im B \\
&\implies \Lambda\dual \subseteq \im B
,\]

and

\[
B^t A = (A^{-t})^t A = A\inv A = I \\
\implies \vector b_i \cdot \vector e_j = \delta_{ij} \in \ZZ \\
\implies \im B \subseteq \spanof~ \Lambda\dual
.\]

$\qed$
