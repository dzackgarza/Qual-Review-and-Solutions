Let $K = \QQ(\zeta)$. 
Then $K$ is the splitting field of $f(x) = x^n - 1$, which is irreducible over $\QQ$, so $K/\QQ$ is normal.
We also have $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ and $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ since they can not share any roots.

> Or equivalently, $f$ splits into distinct linear factors $f(x) = \prod_{k\leq n}(x-\zeta^k)$.

Since it is a Galois extension, $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = [K: \QQ] = \phi(n)$ for the totient function.

We can now define maps
\[
\tau_j: K &\to K \\
\zeta &\mapsto \zeta^j 
\]

and if we restrict to $j$ such that $\gcd(n, j) = 1$, this yields $\phi(n)$ maps.
Noting that if $\zeta$ is a primitive root, then $(n, j) = 1$ implies that that $\zeta^j$ is also a primitive root, and hence another root of $\min(\zeta, \QQ)$, and so these are in fact automorphisms of $K$ that fix $\QQ$ and thus elements of $\Gal(K/\QQ)$.

So define a map
\[
\theta: \ZZ_n\units &\to K \\
[j]_n &\mapsto \tau_j
.\]

from the *multiplicative* group of units to the Galois group.

The claim is that this is a surjective homomorphism, and since both groups are the same size, an isomorphism.

**Surjectivity:**

Letting $\sigma \in K$ be arbitrary, noting that $[K: \QQ]$ has a basis $\theset{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}}$, it suffices to specify $\sigma(\zeta)$ to fully determine the automorphism.
(Since $\sigma(\zeta^k) = \sigma(\zeta)^k$.)

In particular, $\sigma(\zeta)$ satisfies the polynomial $x^n - 1$, since $\sigma(\zeta)^n = \sigma(\zeta^n) = \sigma(1) = 1$, which means $\sigma(\zeta)$ is another root of unity and $\sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^k$ for some $1\leq k \leq n$.

Moreover, since $o(\zeta) = n \in K\units$, we must have $o(\zeta^k) = n \in K\units$ as well. Noting that $\theset{\zeta^i}$ forms a cyclic subgroup $H\leq K\units$, then $o(\zeta^k) = n \iff (n, k) = 1$ (by general theory of cyclic groups).

Thus $\theta$ is surjective.

**Homomorphism:**

\[
\tau_j \circ \tau_k (\zeta) =\tau_j(\zeta^k) = \zeta^{jk} \implies
\tau_{jk} = \theta(jk) = \tau_j \circ \tau_k
.\]

**Part 2:**

We have $K \cong \ZZ_{20}\units$ and $\phi(20) = 8$, so $K \cong \ZZ_8$, so we have the following subgroups and corresponding intermediate fields:

- $0 \sim \QQ(\zeta_{20})$
- $\ZZ_2 \sim \QQ(\omega_1)$
- $\ZZ_4 \sim \QQ(\omega_2)$
- $\ZZ_8 \sim \QQ$

For some elements $\omega_i$ which exist by the primitive element theorem.

### a.

Let $\vector v \in \Lambda$, so $\vector v = \sum_{i=1}^n r_i \vector e_i$ where $r_i \in \ZZ$ for all $i$.

Then if $\vector x = \sum_{j=1}^n s_j \vector e_j \in \Lambda$ is arbitrary, we have $s_j \in \ZZ$ for all $j$ and 
\[
\inner{\vector v}{\vector x} 
&= \inner{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \vector e_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n s_j \vector e_j } \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n r_i s_j \inner{\vector e_i}{\vector e_j }  \in \ZZ
\]

since this is a sum of products of integers (since $\inner{\vector e_i}{\vector e_j} \in \ZZ$ for each $i, j$ pair by assumption) so $\vector v \in \Lambda\dual$ by definition.

### b. 


**$\det M \neq 0$**:

Suppose $\det M = 0$. Then $\ker M \neq \vector 0$, so let $\vector v \in \ker M$ be given by $\vector v = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i \vector e_i \neq \vector 0$. 

Note that 
\[
M\vector v = 0 &\implies
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\vector e_1 \cdot \vector e_1 & \vector e_1 \cdot \vector e_2 & \cdots \\
\vector e_2 \cdot \vector e_1 & \vector e_2 \cdot \vector e_2 & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{array}
\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots
\end{array}\right] = \vector 0 \\ \\
&\implies \sum_{j=1}^n v_j\inner{\vector e_k}{\vector e_j} = 0 \qtext{for each fixed} k
.\]

We can now note that $\inner{\vector e_k}{\vector v} = \sum_{j=1}^n v_j \inner{\vector e_k}{\vector e_j} = 0$ for every $k$ by the above observation, which forces $\vector v = 0$ by non-degeneracy of $\inner{\wait}{\wait}$, a contradiction. 

$\qed$

*Alternative proof:*

Write $M = A^tA$ where $A$ has the $\vector e_i$ as columns. Then
\[
M\vector x = 0 
&\implies A^t A \vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \vector x^t A^t A \vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \norm{A \vector x}^2  = 0 \\
&\implies A\vector x = 0 \\
&\implies \vector x = 0
,\]

since $A$ has full rank because the $\vector e_i$ are linearly independent.

$\qed$

Let $A = [\vector e_1^t, \cdots, \vector e_n^t]$ be the matrix with $\vector e_i$ in the $i$th column.

**The rows of $A\inv$ span $\Lambda\dual$**:

Equivalently, the columns of $A^{-t}$ span $\Lambda\dual$.

Let $B = A^{-t}$ and let $\vector b_i$ denote the columns of $B$, so $\im B = \spanof{\theset{\vector b_i}}$.


Since $A \in \GL(n, \ZZ)$, $A\inv, A^t, A^{-t} \in \GL(n, \ZZ)$ as well.

\[
\vector v \in \Lambda\dual 
&\implies \inner{\vector e_i}{\vector v} = z_i \in \ZZ \quad \forall i \\
&\implies A^t \vector v = \vector z \definedas [z_1, \cdots, z_n] \in \ZZ^n \\
&\implies \vector v = A^{-t} \vector z \definedas B\vector z \in \im B \\
&\implies \vector v \in \im B \\
&\implies \Lambda\dual \subseteq \im B
,\]

and

\[
B^t A = (A^{-t})^t A = A\inv A = I \\
\implies \vector b_i \cdot \vector e_j = \delta_{ij} \in \ZZ \\
\implies \im B \subseteq \spanof~ \Lambda\dual
.\]

$\qed$
