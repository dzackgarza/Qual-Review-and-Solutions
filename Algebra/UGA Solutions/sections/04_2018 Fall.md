### a

Let $\phi$ denote the map in question, it suffices to show that $\phi$ is $R\dash$linear, i.e. $\phi(s\vector x + \vector y) = s\phi(\vector x) + \phi(\vector y)$:

\[
\phi(s\vector x + \vector y) 
&= r(s\vector x + \vector y) \\
&= rs\vector x + r\vector y \\
&= s(r\vector x) + (r\vector y) \\
&= s\phi(\vector x) + \phi(\vector y)
.\]

### b

We identify $\ker \phi = \theset{x\in R \suchthat rx = 0}$, and since $r\neq 0$ by assumption, this implies each such $x$ is a zero divisor by definition (and $\ker \phi$ is nonempty by assumption).

Similarly, we identify $\im \phi = \theset{y = rx \suchthat x\in R}$. 
So let $y\in \im \phi$.
Since $r$ is a zero divisor, there exists some $z\in R$ such that $rz = 0$.

But then 
$$
yz = rxz = xrz = x\cdot 0 = 0
$$ 
since $R$ is commutative, so $y$ is a zero divisor.


### c

> See 1964 Annals "Properties of rings with a finite number of zero divisors"

Let $Z \definedas \theset{z_i}_{i=1}^n$ be the set of $n$ zero divisors in $R$.
Let $\phi_i$ be the $n$ maps $x \mapsto z_i x$, and let $K_i = \ker \phi_i$ be the corresponding kernels.

Fix an $i$.
By (b), $K_i$ consists of zero divisors, so 
$$
\abs{K_i} \leq n < \infty \quad \text{for each } i
.$$

Now consider $R/K_i \definedas \theset{r + K_i}$.
By the first isomorphism theorem, $R/K_i \cong \im \phi$, and by (b) every element in the image is a zero divisor, so 
$$
[R: K_i] = \abs{R/K_i} = \abs{\im \phi_i} \leq n 
.$$

But then 
$$
\abs{R} = [R:K_i]\cdot \abs{K_i} \leq n\cdot n = n^2 
.$$

### d

By (c), if there are exactly 2 zero divisors then $\abs{R} \leq 4$.
Since every element in a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor, and $\abs{R\units} \geq 2$ since $\pm 1$ are always units, we must have $\abs{R} = 4$.

Since the characteristic of a ring must divide its size, we have $\ch R = 2$ or $4$.

Using the hint, we see that only $\ZZ/(4)$ has characteristic 4, which has exactly 2 zero divisors given by $[0]_4$ and $[2]_4$.

If $R$ has characteristic 2, we can check the other 3 possibilities.

We can write $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2) = \theset{a + bt \suchthat a,b\in \ZZ/(2)}$, and checking the multiplication table we have

\[
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
			& 0 & 1 	& t & 1+t 	\\ \hline
0 		& 0 & 0 	& 0 & 0   	\\ 
1 		& 0 & 1 	& t & 1+t 	\\ 
t 		& 0 & t 	& \mathbf{0} & t   	\\ 
1 + t & 0 & 1+t & t & 1   	\\ 
\end{array}
,\]

and so we find that $t, 0$ are the zero divisors.

In $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2 - t)$, we can check that $t^2 = t \implies t t^2 = t^2 \implies t(t^2 + 1) = 0 \implies t(t+1) = 0$, so both $t$ and $t+1$ are zero divisors, along with zero, so this is not a possibility.

Similarly, in $\ZZ/(2)[t]/(t^2 + t + 1)$, we can check the bottom-right corner of the multiplication table to find
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c|cc}
	& t 	& 1 +t \\ \hline
t & 1+t & 1 \\
t & 1 	& t \\
\end{array}\right]
,\]

and so this ring only has one zero divisor.

Thus the only possibilities are:

\[
R &\cong \ZZ/(4) \\
R &\cong \ZZ/(2)[t] / (t^2)
.\]

$\qed$
