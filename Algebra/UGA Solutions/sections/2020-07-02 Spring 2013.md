Let $f$ be the characteristic polynomial of $T$.

$\implies$:

- By contrapositive, suppose there is a proper nonzero invariant subspace $W<V$ with $T(W) \subseteq W$, we will show the characteristic polynomial $f \definedas \chi_{V, T}(x)$ is reducible.
- Since $T(W)\subseteq W$, the restriction $g\definedas \chi_{V, T}(x) \mid_W: W\to W$ is a linear operator on $W$.
- Claim: $g$ divides $f$ in $\FF[x]$ and $\deg(g) < \deg(f)$.
- Thus $f$ is reducible.
