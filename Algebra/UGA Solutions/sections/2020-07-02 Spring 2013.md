Let $f$ be the characteristic polynomial of $T$.

$\implies$:

- By contrapositive
- Suppose $f \definedas \chi_{V, T}(x)$ is irreducible in $\FF[x]$.
- Suppose $W< V$ is proper and nonzero
- Since $T(W)\subseteq W$, the restriction $g\definedas \chi_{V, T}(x) \mid_W: W\to W$ is a linear operator on $W$.
- Claim: $g$ divides $f$ in $\FF[x]$.
- This yields a contradiction, since $f$ was assumed irreducible.
