> Theorem: $F\units$ is always cyclic for $F$ a field

### a

Since $\abs{F} = q$ and $[E:F] = k$, we have $\abs{E} = q^k$ and $\abs{E\units} = q^k-1$.
Noting that $\zeta \in E\units$ we must have $n = o(\zeta) \divides \abs{E\units} = q^k-1$ by Lagrange's theorem.

### b

Rephrasing (a), we have 
\[
n \divides q^k-1 
&\iff q^k-1 \cong 0 \mod n \\
&\iff q^k \cong 1 \mod n \\
&\iff m \definedas o(q) \divides k
.\]

### c

Since $m\divides k \iff k = \ell m$, (**claim**) there is an intermediate subfield $M$ such that
\[
E \leq M \leq F \quad k = [F:E] = [F:M] [M:E] = \ell m
,\]

so $M$ is a degree $m$ extension of $E$.

Now consider $M\units$. 
By the argument in (a), $n$ divides $q^m - 1 = \abs{M\units}$, and $M\units$ is cyclic, so it contains a cyclic subgroup $H$ of order $n$.

But then $x\in H \implies p(x)\definedas x^n-1 = 0$, and since $p(x)$ has at most $n$ roots in a field. 
So $H = \theset{x \in M \suchthat x^n-1 = 0}$, i.e. $H$ contains all solutions to $x^n-1$ in $E[x]$.

But $\zeta$ is one such solution, so $\zeta \in H \subset M\units \subset M$.
Since $F[\zeta]$ is the smallest field extension containing $\zeta$, we must have $F = M$, so $\ell = 1$, and $k = m$.
