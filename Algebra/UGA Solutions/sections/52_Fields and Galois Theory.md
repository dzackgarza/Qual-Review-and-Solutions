> Theorem: $F\units$ is always cyclic for $F$ a field

### a

Since $\abs{F} = q$ and $[E:F] = k$, we have $\abs{E} = q^k$ and $\abs{E\units} = q^k-1$.
Noting that $\zeta \in E\units$ we must have $n = o(\zeta) \divides \abs{E\units} = q^k-1$ by Lagrange's theorem.

### b

Rephrasing (a), we have 
\[
n \divides q^k-1 
&\iff q^k-1 \cong 0 \mod n \\
&\iff q^k \cong 1 \mod n \\
&\iff m \definedas o(q) \divides k
.\]

### c

Since $m\divides k \iff k = \ell m$, (**claim**) there is an intermediate subfield $M$ such that
\[
E \leq M \leq F \quad k = [F:E] = [F:M] [M:E] = \ell m
,\]

so $M$ is a degree $m$ extension of $E$.

Now consider $M\units$. 
By the argument in (a), $n$ divides $q^m - 1 = \abs{M\units}$, and $M\units$ is cyclic, so it contains a cyclic subgroup $H$ of order $n$.

But then $x\in H \implies p(x)\definedas x^n-1 = 0$, and since $p(x)$ has at most $n$ roots in a field. 
So $H = \theset{x \in M \suchthat x^n-1 = 0}$, i.e. $H$ contains all solutions to $x^n-1$ in $E[x]$.

But $\zeta$ is one such solution, so $\zeta \in H \subset M\units \subset M$.
Since $F[\zeta]$ is the smallest field extension containing $\zeta$, we must have $F = M$, so $\ell = 1$, and $k = m$.

Let $K = \QQ(\zeta)$. 
Then $K$ is the splitting field of $f(x) = x^n - 1$, which is irreducible over $\QQ$, so $K/\QQ$ is normal.
We also have $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ and $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ since they can not share any roots.

> Or equivalently, $f$ splits into distinct linear factors $f(x) = \prod_{k\leq n}(x-\zeta^k)$.

Since it is a Galois extension, $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = [K: \QQ] = \phi(n)$ for the totient function.

We can now define maps
\[
\tau_j: K &\to K \\
\zeta &\mapsto \zeta^j 
\]

and if we restrict to $j$ such that $\gcd(n, j) = 1$, this yields $\phi(n)$ maps.
Noting that if $\zeta$ is a primitive root, then $(n, j) = 1$ implies that that $\zeta^j$ is also a primitive root, and hence another root of $\min(\zeta, \QQ)$, and so these are in fact automorphisms of $K$ that fix $\QQ$ and thus elements of $\Gal(K/\QQ)$.

So define a map
\[
\theta: \ZZ_n\units &\to K \\
[j]_n &\mapsto \tau_j
.\]

from the *multiplicative* group of units to the Galois group.

The claim is that this is a surjective homomorphism, and since both groups are the same size, an isomorphism.

**Surjectivity:**

Letting $\sigma \in K$ be arbitrary, noting that $[K: \QQ]$ has a basis $\theset{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}}$, it suffices to specify $\sigma(\zeta)$ to fully determine the automorphism.
(Since $\sigma(\zeta^k) = \sigma(\zeta)^k$.)

In particular, $\sigma(\zeta)$ satisfies the polynomial $x^n - 1$, since $\sigma(\zeta)^n = \sigma(\zeta^n) = \sigma(1) = 1$, which means $\sigma(\zeta)$ is another root of unity and $\sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^k$ for some $1\leq k \leq n$.

Moreover, since $o(\zeta) = n \in K\units$, we must have $o(\zeta^k) = n \in K\units$ as well. Noting that $\theset{\zeta^i}$ forms a cyclic subgroup $H\leq K\units$, then $o(\zeta^k) = n \iff (n, k) = 1$ (by general theory of cyclic groups).

Thus $\theta$ is surjective.

**Homomorphism:**

\[
\tau_j \circ \tau_k (\zeta) =\tau_j(\zeta^k) = \zeta^{jk} \implies
\tau_{jk} = \theta(jk) = \tau_j \circ \tau_k
.\]

**Part 2:**

We have $K \cong \ZZ_{20}\units$ and $\phi(20) = 8$, so $K \cong \ZZ_8$, so we have the following subgroups and corresponding intermediate fields:

- $0 \sim \QQ(\zeta_{20})$
- $\ZZ_2 \sim \QQ(\omega_1)$
- $\ZZ_4 \sim \QQ(\omega_2)$
- $\ZZ_8 \sim \QQ$

For some elements $\omega_i$ which exist by the primitive element theorem.

### (a)

> Go to a field extension.
> Orders of multiplicative groups for finite fields are known.

We can consider the quotient $K = \displaystyle{\frac{\FF_p[x]}{\generators{\pi(x)}}}$, which since $\pi(x)$ is irreducible is an extension of $\FF_p$ of degree $d$ and thus a field of size $p^d$ with a natural quotient map of rings $\rho: \FF_p[x] \to K$.

Since $K\units$ is a group of size $p^d-1$, we know that for any $y \in K\units$, we have by Lagrange's theorem that the order of $y$ divides $p^d-1$ and so $y^{p^d} = y$.

So every element in $K$ is a root of $q(x) = x^{p^d}-x$.

Since $\rho$ is a ring morphism, we have

\[
\rho(q(x)) = \rho(x^{p^d} - x) = \rho(x)^{p^d} - \rho(x)
&= 0 \in K \\
&\iff q(x) \in \ker \rho \\
&\iff q(x) \in \generators{\pi(x)} \\
&\iff \pi(x) \divides q(x) = x^{p^d}-x \quad\text{"to contain is to divide"}
.\]

$\qed$

### (b)

> Some potentially useful facts:
>
> - $\GF(p^n)$ is the splitting field of $x^{p^n} - x \in \FF_p[x]$.
> - $x^{p^d} - x \divides x^{p^n} - x \iff d \divides n$
> - $\GF(p^d) \leq \GF(p^n) \iff d\divides n$
> - $x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$.

Claim: $\pi(x)$ divides $x^{p^n}-x \iff \deg \pi$ divides $n$.

$\implies$:
Let $L \cong \GF(p^n)$ be the splitting field of $\phi_n(x) \definedas x^{p^n}-x$; then since $\pi \divides \phi_n$ by assumption, $\pi$ splits in $L$.
Let $\alpha \in L$ be any root of $\pi$; then there is a tower of extensions $\FF_p \leq \FF_p(\alpha) \leq L$.

Then $\FF_p \leq \FF_p(\alpha) \leq L$, and so
\[
n &= [L: \FF_p] \\
&= [L: \FF_p(\alpha)]~[\FF_p(\alpha): \FF_p] \\
&= \ell d
,\]

for some $\ell \in \ZZ^{\geq 1}$, so $d$ divides $n$.


$\impliedby$:
If $d\divides n$, use the fact (claim) that $x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$. 
So $f = f_i$ for some $i$.

$\qed$

## Spring 2019 #8

Concepts used:

- $\zeta_n \definedas e^{2\pi i \over n}$, and $\zeta_n^k$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity $\iff \gcd(n, k) = 1$
  - In general, $\zeta_n^k$ is a primitive ${n \over \gcd(n, k)}$th root of unity.
- $\deg \Phi_n(x) = \phi(n)$
- $\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = p^{k-1}(p-1)$ (proof: for a nontrivial gcd, the possibilities are $p, 2p, 3p, 4p, \cdots, p^{k-2}p, p^{k-1}p$.)
- $\Gal(\QQ(\zeta)/\QQ) \cong \ZZ/(n)\units$

Let $K = \QQ(\zeta)$

### a

- $\zeta \definedas e^{2\pi i / 8}$ is a primitive $8$th root of unity
- The minimal polynomial of an $n$th root of unity is the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_n$
- The degree of the field extension is the degree of $\Phi_8$, which is
\[
\phi(8) = \phi(2^3) = 2^{3-1} \cdot (2-1) = 4
.\]
- So $[\QQ(\zeta): \QQ] = 4$.

### b
- $\Gal(\QQ(\zeta)/\QQ) \cong \ZZ/(8)\units \cong \ZZ/(4)$ by general theory 
- $\ZZ/(4)$ has exactly one subgroup of index 2.
- Thus there is exactly **one** intermediate field of degree 2 (a quadratic extension).

### c
- Let $L = \QQ(\zeta, \sqrt[4] 2)$.

- Note $\QQ(\zeta) = \QQ(i, \sqrt 2)$
  - $\QQ(i, \sqrt{2})\subseteq \QQ(\zeta)$
    - $\zeta_8^2 = i$, and $\zeta_8 = \sqrt{2}\inv + i\sqrt{2}\inv$ so $\zeta_8 + \zeta_8 \inv = 2/\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}$.
  - $\QQ(\zeta) \subseteq \QQ(i, \sqrt{2})$: 
    - $\zeta = e^{2\pi i / 8} = \sin(\pi/4) + i\cos(\pi/4) = {\sqrt 2 \over 2}\qty{1+i}$.

- Thus $L = \QQ(i, \sqrt{2})(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \QQ(i, \sqrt 2, \sqrt[4] 2) = \QQ(i, \sqrt[4]{2})$.
  - Uses the fact that $\QQ(\sqrt 2) \subseteq \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)$ since $\sqrt[4]{2}^2 = \sqrt{2}$ 

- Conclude
\[
[L: \QQ] = [L: \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)] ~[\QQ(\sqrt[4] 2): \QQ] = 2 \cdot 4 = 8
\]
  using the fact that the minimal polynomial of $i$ over any subfield of $\RR$ is always $x^2 + 1$, so $\min_{\QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)}(i) = x^2 + 1$ which is degree 2.


## Fall 2018 #3

Let $L/K/F$.

### a

**False**: 
Take $L/K/F = \QQ(\zeta_2, \sqrt[3] 2) \to \QQ(\sqrt[3] 2) \to \QQ$.

Then $L/F$ is Galois, since it is the splitting field of $x^3 - 2$ and $\QQ$ has characteristic zero.

But $K/F$ is not Galois, since it is not the splitting field of any irreducible polynomial.

### b

**True**: 
If $L/F$ is Galois, then $L/K$ is normal and separable:

- $L/K$ is normal, since if $\sigma: L \injects \overline K$ lifts the identity on $K$ and fixes $L$, i-t also lifts the identity on $F$ and fixes $L$ (and $\overline K = \overline F$).

- $L/K$ is separable, since $F[x] \subseteq K[x]$, and so if $\alpha \in L$ where $f(x) \definedas \min(\alpha, F)$ has no repeated factors, then $f'(x) \definedas \min(\alpha, K)$ divides $f$ and thus can not have repeated factors.

### c

**False**: 
Use the fact that every quadratic extension is Galois, and take $L/K/F = \QQ(\sqrt[4] 2) \to \QQ(\sqrt 2) \to \QQ$.

Then each successive extension is quadratic (thus Galois) but $\QQ(\sqrt[4] 2)$ is not the splitting field of any polynomial (noting that it does not split $x^4 - 2$ completely.)

## Fall 2018 #4
Let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\phi$.
If the polynomial $f(x) = x$ doesn't divide $m$, then $f$ does not have zero as an eigenvalue, so $\phi$ is nonsingular and since $0$ is nilpotent, $\phi + 0$ works.

Otherwise, write $\phi(x) = x^m \rho(x)$ where $\gcd(x, \rho(x)) = 1$.

Then
\begin{align*}
V \cong \frac{k[x]}{m(x)} \cong \frac{k[x]}{(x^m)} \oplus \frac{k[x]}{(\rho)}
\definedas U \oplus W
\end{align*}
by the Chinese Remainder theorem.

We can now note that $\restrictionof{\phi}{U}$ is nilpotent because it has characteristic polynomial $x^m$, and $\restrictionof{\phi}{W}$ is nonsingular since $\lambda = 0$ is not an eigenvalue by construction.


## Spring 2018 #2

\todo{Not the nicest proof! Would be better to replace the ad-hoc computations at the end.}

### a

Note that $g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 2$ has roots $\beta = 2 \pm \sqrt{2}$, and so $f$ has roots 
\[
\alpha_1 &= \sqrt{2 + \sqrt 2} \\
\alpha_2 &= \sqrt{2 - \sqrt 2} \\
\alpha_3 &= -\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_4 &= -\alpha_2
.\]

and splitting field $K = \QQ(\theset{\alpha_i})$.

### b

$K$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial and thus Galois over $\QQ$.
Moreover, Since $f$ is irreducible by Eisenstein with $p=2$, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S^4$, so the possibilities are:

- $S_4$
- $A_4$
- $D_4$
- $\ZZ/(2) \cross \ZZ/(2)$
- $\ZZ/(4)$

We can note that $g$ splits over $L \definedas \QQ(\sqrt 2)$, an extension of degree 2.

We can now note that $\min(\alpha, L)$ is given by $p(x) = x^2 - (2 + \sqrt 2)$, and so $[K: L] = 2$.

We then have
\[
[K: \QQ] = [K: L] [L : \QQ] = (2)(2) = 4
.\]

This $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = 4$, which leaves only two possibilities:

- $\ZZ/(2) \cross \ZZ/(2)$
- $\ZZ/(4)$

We can next check orders of elements.
Take
\[
\sigma &\in \Gal(K/\QQ) \\
\alpha_1 &\mapsto \alpha_2
.\]


Computations show that 

- $\alpha_1^2 \alpha_2^2 = 2$, so $\alpha_1 \alpha_2 = \sqrt 2$
- $\alpha_1^2 = 2 + \sqrt 2 \implies \sqrt 2 = \alpha_1^2 - 2$

and thus
\[
\sigma^2(\alpha_1) &= \sigma(\alpha_2) \\
&= \sigma\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\alpha_1}\right) \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\sqrt 2)}{\sigma(\alpha_1)} \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\alpha_1^2 - 2)}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \frac{\alpha_2^2 - 2}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -2\alpha_2\inv \\
&= \alpha_2 - \frac{2\alpha_1}{\sqrt 2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -\alpha_1 \sqrt 2 \\
&\neq \alpha_1
,\]

and so the order of $\sigma$ is strictly greater than 2, and thus 4, and thus $\Gal(K/\QQ) = \theset{\sigma^k \suchthat 1\leq k \leq 4} \cong \ZZ/(4)$.

### c


?? The subgroup of index 2 $\generators{\sigma^2}$ corresponds to the field extension $Q(\sqrt 2) / \QQ$.

## Spring 2018 #3

> Moral: $H_1 \intersect H_2 \iff E_1 E_2$, $H_1 H_2 \iff E_1 \intersect E_2$.

### a

By the Galois correspondence, it suffices to show that the fixed field of $H_1 \intersect H_2$ is $E_1 E_2$.

Let $\sigma \in H_1 \intersect H_2$; then $\sigma \in \Aut(K)$ fixes both $E_1$ and $E_2$.

> Not sure if this works -- compositum is not literally product..?

Writing $x \in E_1E_2$ as $x=e_1 e_2$, we have 
$$
\sigma(x) = \sigma(e_1 e_2) = \sigma(e_1) \sigma(e_2) = e_1 e_2  =x,
$$

so $\sigma$ fixes $E_1 E_2$.

### b

That $H_1 H_2 \subseteq G$ is clear, since if $\sigma = \tau_1 \tau_2 \in H_1 H_2$, then each $\tau_i$ is an automorphism of $K$ that fixes $E_i \supseteq \QQ$, so each $\tau_i$ fixes $\QQ$ and thus $\sigma$ fixes $\QQ$.

That it is a subgroup follows from the fact that elements commute. (?)
 
To see this, let $\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \in H_1 H_2$.

Note that $\sigma_1(e) = e$ for all $e\in E_1$ by definition, since $H_1$ fixes $E_1$, and $\sigma_2(e) \in E_1$ (?).

Then 
$$
\sigma_1(e) = e \quad \forall e \in E_1 \implies \sigma_1(\sigma_2(e)) = \sigma_2(e) 
$$  

and substituting $e = \sigma_1(e)$ on the RHS yields

\[
\sigma_1 \sigma_2(e) = \sigma_2 \sigma_1(e)
,\]

where a similar proof holds for $e\in E_2$ and thus for arbitrary $x\in E_1 E_2$.


### c

By the Galois correspondence, the subgroup $H_1H_2 \leq G$ will correspond to an intermediate field $E$ such that $K/E/\QQ$ and $E$ is the fixed field of $H_1 H_2$.

But if $\sigma \in H_1 H_2$, then $\sigma = \tau_1 \tau_2$ where $\tau_i$ is an automorphism of $K$ that fixes $E_i$, and so $\sigma(x) = x \iff \tau_1\tau_2(x) = x \iff \tau_2(x) = x ~\&~ \tau_1(x) = x \iff x \in E_1 \intersect E_2$.
