> Theorem: $F\units$ is always cyclic for $F$ a field

### a

Since $\abs{F} = q$ and $[E:F] = k$, we have $\abs{E} = q^k$ and $\abs{E\units} = q^k-1$.
Noting that $\zeta \in E\units$ we must have $n = o(\zeta) \divides \abs{E\units} = q^k-1$ by Lagrange's theorem.

### b

Rephrasing (a), we have 
\[
n \divides q^k-1 
&\iff q^k-1 \cong 0 \mod n \\
&\iff q^k \cong 1 \mod n \\
&\iff m \definedas o(q) \divides k
.\]

### c

Since $m\divides k \iff k = \ell m$, (**claim**) there is an intermediate subfield $M$ such that
\[
E \leq M \leq F \quad k = [F:E] = [F:M] [M:E] = \ell m
,\]

so $M$ is a degree $m$ extension of $E$.

Now consider $M\units$. 
By the argument in (a), $n$ divides $q^m - 1 = \abs{M\units}$, and $M\units$ is cyclic, so it contains a cyclic subgroup $H$ of order $n$.

But then $x\in H \implies p(x)\definedas x^n-1 = 0$, and since $p(x)$ has at most $n$ roots in a field. 
So $H = \theset{x \in M \suchthat x^n-1 = 0}$, i.e. $H$ contains all solutions to $x^n-1$ in $E[x]$.

But $\zeta$ is one such solution, so $\zeta \in H \subset M\units \subset M$.
Since $F[\zeta]$ is the smallest field extension containing $\zeta$, we must have $F = M$, so $\ell = 1$, and $k = m$.

Let $K = \QQ(\zeta)$. 
Then $K$ is the splitting field of $f(x) = x^n - 1$, which is irreducible over $\QQ$, so $K/\QQ$ is normal.
We also have $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ and $\gcd(f, f') = 1$ since they can not share any roots.

> Or equivalently, $f$ splits into distinct linear factors $f(x) = \prod_{k\leq n}(x-\zeta^k)$.

Since it is a Galois extension, $\abs{\Gal(K/\QQ)} = [K: \QQ] = \phi(n)$ for the totient function.

We can now define maps
\[
\tau_j: K &\to K \\
\zeta &\mapsto \zeta^j 
\]

and if we restrict to $j$ such that $\gcd(n, j) = 1$, this yields $\phi(n)$ maps.
Noting that if $\zeta$ is a primitive root, then $(n, j) = 1$ implies that that $\zeta^j$ is also a primitive root, and hence another root of $\min(\zeta, \QQ)$, and so these are in fact automorphisms of $K$ that fix $\QQ$ and thus elements of $\Gal(K/\QQ)$.

So define a map
\[
\theta: \ZZ_n\units &\to K \\
[j]_n &\mapsto \tau_j
.\]

from the *multiplicative* group of units to the Galois group.

The claim is that this is a surjective homomorphism, and since both groups are the same size, an isomorphism.

**Surjectivity:**

Letting $\sigma \in K$ be arbitrary, noting that $[K: \QQ]$ has a basis $\theset{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}}$, it suffices to specify $\sigma(\zeta)$ to fully determine the automorphism.
(Since $\sigma(\zeta^k) = \sigma(\zeta)^k$.)

In particular, $\sigma(\zeta)$ satisfies the polynomial $x^n - 1$, since $\sigma(\zeta)^n = \sigma(\zeta^n) = \sigma(1) = 1$, which means $\sigma(\zeta)$ is another root of unity and $\sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^k$ for some $1\leq k \leq n$.

Moreover, since $o(\zeta) = n \in K\units$, we must have $o(\zeta^k) = n \in K\units$ as well. Noting that $\theset{\zeta^i}$ forms a cyclic subgroup $H\leq K\units$, then $o(\zeta^k) = n \iff (n, k) = 1$ (by general theory of cyclic groups).

Thus $\theta$ is surjective.

**Homomorphism:**

\[
\tau_j \circ \tau_k (\zeta) =\tau_j(\zeta^k) = \zeta^{jk} \implies
\tau_{jk} = \theta(jk) = \tau_j \circ \tau_k
.\]

**Part 2:**

We have $K \cong \ZZ_{20}\units$ and $\phi(20) = 8$, so $K \cong \ZZ_8$, so we have the following subgroups and corresponding intermediate fields:

- $0 \sim \QQ(\zeta_{20})$
- $\ZZ_2 \sim \QQ(\omega_1)$
- $\ZZ_4 \sim \QQ(\omega_2)$
- $\ZZ_8 \sim \QQ$

For some elements $\omega_i$ which exist by the primitive element theorem.

> Go to a field extension.
> Orders of multiplicative groups for finite fields are known.

We can consider the quotient $K = \displaystyle{\frac{\FF_p[x]}{\generators{\pi(x)}}}$, which since $\pi(x)$ is irreducible is an extension of $\FF_p$ of degree $d$ and thus a field of size $p^d$ with a natural quotient map of rings $\rho: \FF_p[x] \to K$.

Since $K\units$ is a group of size $p^d-1$, we know that for any $y \in K\units$, we have by Lagrange's theorem that the order of $y$ divides $p^d-1$ and so $y^{p^d} = y$.

So every element in $K$ is a root of $q(x) = x^{p^d}-x$.

Since $\rho$ is a ring morphism, we have

\[
\rho(q(x)) = \rho(x^{p^d} - x) = \rho(x)^{p^d} - \rho(x)
&= 0 \in K \\
&\iff q(x) \in \ker \rho \\
&\iff q(x) \in \generators{\pi(x)} \\
&\iff \pi(x) \divides q(x) = x^{p^d}-x \quad\text{"to contain is to divide"}
.\]

### (b)

> Some potentially useful facts:
>
> - $\GF(p^n)$ is the splitting field of $x^{p^n} - x \in \FF_p[x]$.
> - $x^{p^d} - x \divides x^{p^n} - x \iff d \divides n$
> - $\GF(p^d) \leq \GF(p^n) \iff d\divides n$
> - $x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$.

Claim: $\pi(x)$ divides $x^{p^n}-x \iff \deg \pi$ divides $n$.

$\implies$:
Let $L \cong \GF(p^n)$ be the splitting field of $\phi_n(x) \definedas x^{p^n}-x$; then since $\pi \divides \phi_n$ by assumption, $\pi$ splits in $L$.
Let $\alpha \in L$ be any root of $\pi$; then there is a tower of extensions $\FF_p \leq \FF_p(\alpha) \leq L$.

Then $\FF_p \leq \FF_p(\alpha) \leq L$, and so
\[
n &= [L: \FF_p] \\
&= [L: \FF_p(\alpha)]~[\FF_p(\alpha): \FF_p] \\
&= \ell d
,\]

for some $\ell \in \ZZ^{\geq 1}$, so $d$ divides $n$.


$\impliedby$:
If $d\divides n$, use the fact (claim) that $x^{p^n} - x = \prod f_i(x)$ over all irreducible monic $f_i$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$. 
So $f = f_i$ for some $i$.

$\qed$
