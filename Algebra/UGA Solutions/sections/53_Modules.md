# Modules

## Torsion and the Structure Theorem

### a

By the correspondence theorem, submodules of $M/N$ biject with submodules $A$ of $M$ containing $N$.

So 

- $M$ is maximal:

- $\iff$ no such (proper, nontrivial) submodule $A$ exists 

- $\iff$ there are no (proper, nontrivial) submodules of $M/N$ 

- $\iff M/N$ is simple.

### b

Identify $\ZZ\dash$modules with abelian groups, then by (a), $N$ is maximal $\iff$ $M/N$ is simple $\iff$ $M/N$ has no nontrivial proper subgroups.

By Cauchy's theorem, if $\abs{M/N} = ab$ is a composite number, then $a\divides ab \implies$ there is an element (and thus a subgroup) of order $a$.
In this case, $M/N$ contains a nontrivial proper cyclic subgroup, so $M/N$ is not simple.
So $\abs{M/N}$ can not be composite, and therefore must be prime.

### c

Let $G = \theset{x \in \CC \suchthat x^n=1 \text{ for some }n\in \NN}$, and suppose $H < G$ is a proper subgroup.

Then there must be a prime $p$ such that the $\zeta_{p^k} \not \in H$ for all $k$ greater than some constant $m$ -- otherwise, we can use the fact that if $\zeta_{p^k} \in H$ then $\zeta_{p^\ell} \in H$ for all $\ell \leq k$, and if $\zeta_{p^k} \in H$ for all $p$ and all $k$ then $H = G$.

But this means there are infinitely many elements in $G\setminus H$, and so $\infty = [G: H] = \abs{G/H}$ is not a prime. 
Thus by (b), $H$ can not be maximal, a contradiction.

$\qed$
