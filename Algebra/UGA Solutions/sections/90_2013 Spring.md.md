Possibly useful facts:

- Normal subgroups correspond to normal extensions (any polynomial with one root in the extension $L/k$ splits in $L$)
- If $L$ is finite and separable (automatic if $K$ is finite or characteristic zero), then $L/k$ is normal iff $L$ is the splitting field of an irreducible polynomial in $k[x]$.
