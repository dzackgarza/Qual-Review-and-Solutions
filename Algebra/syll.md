Theory of Rings and Modules

basic properties of ideals and quotient rings

fundamental homomorphism theorems for rings and modules

characterizations and properties of special domains such as:

Euclidean implies PID implies UFD

Euclidean

domains

applications to the structure of:

finitely generated abelian groups

As a general rule, students are responsible for knowing both the theory
(proofs) and practical

applications (e.g. how to find the Jordan or rational canonical form of
a given matrix, or the

Galois group of a given polynomial) of the topics mentioned. A
