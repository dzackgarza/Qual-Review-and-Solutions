:::{.theorem title="Morera's Theorem" ref="Morera"}
If $f$ is continuous on a domain $\Omega$ and $\int_T f = 0$ for every triangle $T\subset \Omega$, then $f$ is holomorphic.

:::{.theorem title="Maximum Modulus" ref="MaximumModulus"}
If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant on an open connected region $\Omega$, then $\abs{f}$ can not attain a maximum on $\Omega$.
If $\Omega$ is bounded and $f$ is continuous on $\bar \Omega$, then $\max_{\bar \Omega} \abs{f}$ occurs on $\bd \Omega$.
Conversely, if $f$ attains a local supremum at $z_0 \in \Omega$, then $f$ is constant on $\Omega$.

:::{.theorem title="Liouville's Theorem" ref="Liouville"}
If $f$ is entire and bounded, $f$ is constant.

:::{.theorem title="Cauchy Integral Formula" ref="CauchyIntegral"}
Suppose $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$, then 
\[
f(z) = {1 \over 2\pi i} \oint_{\bd \Omega} {f(\xi) \over \xi-z}\,d\xi
\]
and
\[
\dd{^nf }{z^n}(z) = {n! \over 2\pi i} \int_{\bd \Omega} {f(\xi) \over (\xi - z)^{n+1}} \,d\xi
.\]
:::

:::{.theorem title="Cauchy's Inequality" ref="CauchyInequality"}
For $z_0 \in D_R(z_0) \subset \Omega$, we have
\[
\abs{ f^{(n)} (z_0) } 
\leq \frac{n !}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{ \norm{f}_{\infty} } {R^{n+1}} R \,d\theta
= \frac{n !\norm{f}_{\infty}}{R^n} 
,\]
where $\norm{f}_{\infty}\definedas \sup_{z\in C_R} \abs{f(z)}$.

:::{.theorem title="Argument Principle"}
For $f$ meromorphic in $\gamma^\circ$, if $f$ has no poles and is nonvanishing on $\gamma$ then
\[  
\Delta_\gamma \arg f(z) = \int_\gamma {f'(z) \over f(z)} \,dz = 2\pi (Z_f - P_f)
,\]
where $Z_f$ and $P_f$ are the number of zeros and poles respectively enclosed by $\gamma$, counted with multiplicity.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Rouch√©'s Theorem" ref="Rouche"}
If $f, g$ are analytic on a domain $\Omega$ with finitely many zeros in $\Omega$ and $\gamma \subset \Omega$ is a closed curve surrounding each point exactly once, where $\abs{g} < \abs{f}$ on $\gamma$, then $f$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeros.

Alternatively:

Suppose $f = g + h$ with $g \neq 0, \infty$ on $\gamma$ with $\abs g > \abs h$ on $\gamma$.
Then $$\Delta_\gamma \arg(f) = \Delta_\gamma \arg(h)\quad\text{ and } Z_f - P_f = Z_g - P_g.$$

Then
\[  
\int_\gamma f(z) \,dz = 2\pi i \sum_{k=1}^N \res_{z_k} f
.\]

2. $\abs{f'(0)} \leq 1$.

Moreover, if $\abs{f(z_0)} = \abs{z_0}$ for any $z_0\in \DD$ or $\abs{f'(0)} = 1$, then $f$ is a rotation

:::{.theorem title="Classification of Conformal Maps"}
There are 8 major types of conformal maps:

| Type/Domains                                            | Formula                                   |
| ------------                                            | -------                                   |
| Translation/Dilation/Rotation                           | $z\mapsto e^{i\theta}(cz + h)$            |
| Sectors to sectors                                      | $z\mapsto z^n$                            |

:::{.theorem title="Characterization of conformal maps"}
Conformal maps $\DD\to\DD$ have the form
\[
g(z) = \lambda {1-a \over 1 - \bar a z}, \quad \abs{a} < 1, \quad \abs{\lambda} = 1
.\]
:::

### Others

:::{.theorem title="Riemann Mapping"}
If $\Omega$ is simply connected, nonempty, and not $\CC$, then for every $z_{0}\in \Omega$ there exists a unique conformal map $F:\Omega \to \DD$ such that $F(z_{0}) = 0$ and $F'(z_{0}) > 0$.

Thus any two such sets $\Omega_{1}, \Omega_{2}$ are conformally equivalent.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Riemann's Removable Singularity Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ except possibly at $z_0$ and $f$ is bounded on $\Omega\setminus\theset{z_0}$, then $z_0$ is a removable singularity.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Holomorphic functions have harmonic components"}
If $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$ is holomorphic, then $u, v$ are harmonic.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Holomorphic functions are continuous."}
$f$ is holomorphic at $z_0$ iff there exists an $a\in \CC$ such that
\[  
f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0) - ah = h \psi(h), \quad \psi(h) \converges{h\to 0}\to 0
.\]
In this case, $a = f'(z_0)$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Cauchy-Riemann implies holomorphic"}
If $f = u+iv$ with $u, v\in C^1(\RR)$ satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations on $\Omega$, then $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ and $f'(z) = \dd{f}{z} = {1 \over 2} \qty{\dd{}{x} + {1\over i} \dd{}{y}}f$.
:::

## Series and Analytic Functions

:::{.proposition title="Power Series are Smooth"}
Any power series is smooth and its derivatives can be obtained using term-by-term differentiation.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Uniform Convergence of Series"}
A series of functions $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)$ converges uniformly iff 
\[  
\lim_{n\to \infty} \norm{ \sum_{k\geq n} f_k }_\infty = 0
.\]

Moreover, if the $f_n$ are continuous, by the uniform limit theorem, $f$ is again continuous.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Exponential is uniformly convergent in discs"}
$f(z) = e^z$ is uniformly convergent in any disc in $\CC$.
:::

:::{.proof}
Apply the estimate
\[  
\abs{e^z} \leq \sum {\abs {z}^n \over n!} = e^{\abs{z}}
.\]
Now by the $M\dash$test, 
\[  
\abs{z} \leq R < \infty \implies \abs{\sum {z^n \over n!}} \leq e^R < \infty
.\]
:::

:::{.proposition title="Checking radius of convergence"}
For a power series $f(z) = \sum a_n z^n$, define $R$ by
\[  
{1\over R}\definedas \limsup \abs{a_n}^{1\over n}
.\]

Then $f$ converges absolutely on $\abs{z} < R$ and diverges on $\abs{z} > R$.
