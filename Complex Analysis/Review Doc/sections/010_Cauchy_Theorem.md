:::{.theorem title="Cauchy's Theorem" ref="CauchyTheorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$, then 
\[  
\int_{\bd \Omega} f(z) \, dz = 0
.\]

> Slogan: closed path integrals of holomorphic functions vanish.

:::

:::{.theorem title="Morera's Theorem" ref="Morera"}
If $f$ is continuous on a domain $\Omega$ and $\int_T f = 0$ for every triangle $T\subset \Omega$, then $f$ is holomorphic.

> Slogan: if every integral along a triangle vanishes, implies holomorphic.

:::{.theorem title="Maximum Modulus" ref="MaximumModulus"}
If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant on an open connected region $\Omega$, then $\abs{f}$ can not attain a maximum on $\Omega$.
If $\Omega$ is bounded and $f$ is continuous on $\bar \Omega$, then $\max_{\bar \Omega} \abs{f}$ occurs on $\bd \Omega$.
Conversely, if $f$ attains a local supremum at $z_0 \in \Omega$, then $f$ is constant on $\Omega$.

:::{.theorem title="Liouville's Theorem" ref="Liouville"}
If $f$ is entire and bounded, $f$ is constant.

:::{.theorem title="Cauchy Integral Formula" ref="CauchyIntegral"}
Suppose $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$, then 
\[
f(z) = {1 \over 2\pi i} \oint_{\bd \Omega} {f(\xi) \over \xi-z}\,d\xi
\]
and
\[
\dd{^nf }{z^n}(z) = {n! \over 2\pi i} \int_{\bd \Omega} {f(\xi) \over (\xi - z)^{n+1}} \,d\xi
.\]
:::

:::{.theorem title="Cauchy's Inequality" ref="CauchyInequality"}
For $z_0 \in D_R(z_0) \subset \Omega$, we have
\[
\abs{ f^{(n)} (z_0) } 
\leq \frac{n !}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{ \norm{f}_{\infty} } {R^{n+1}} R \,d\theta
= \frac{n !\norm{f}_{\infty}}{R^n} 
,\]
where $\norm{f}_{\infty}\definedas \sup_{z\in C_R} \abs{f(z)}$.

:::{.slogan}
The $n$th Taylor coefficient of an analytic function is at most $\sup_{\abs z = R} \abs{f}/R^n$.

:::{.theorem title="Argument Principle"}
For $f$ meromorphic in $\gamma^\circ$, if $f$ has no poles and is nonvanishing on $\gamma$ then
\[  
\Delta_\gamma \arg f(z) = \int_\gamma {f'(z) \over f(z)} \,dz = 2\pi (Z_f - P_f)
,\]
where $Z_f$ and $P_f$ are the number of zeros and poles respectively enclosed by $\gamma$, counted with multiplicity.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Rouch√©'s Theorem" ref="Rouche"}
If $f, g$ are analytic on a domain $\Omega$ with finitely many zeros in $\Omega$ and $\gamma \subset \Omega$ is a closed curve surrounding each point exactly once, where $\abs{g} < \abs{f}$ on $\gamma$, then $f$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeros.

Alternatively:

Suppose $f = g + h$ with $g \neq 0, \infty$ on $\gamma$ with $\abs g > \abs h$ on $\gamma$.
Then $$\Delta_\gamma \arg(f) = \Delta_\gamma \arg(h)\quad\text{ and } Z_f - P_f = Z_g - P_g.$$
:::

:::{.theorem title="The Residue Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on an open set $\Omega$ containing a curve $\gamma$ and its interior $\gamma^\circ$, except for finitely many poles $\theset{z_k}_{k=1}^N \subset \gamma^\circ$.
Then
\[  
\int_\gamma f(z) \,dz = 2\pi i \sum_{k=1}^N \res_{z_k} f
.\]
:::

:::{.theorem title="Mean Value Theorem for Holomorphic Functions"}
\[
f(z_0) = {1\over \pi r^2} \iint_{D_r(z_0)} f(z)\, dA
.\]

:::{.theorem title="Riemann Mapping"}
If $\Omega$ is simply connected, nonempty, and not $\CC$, then for every $z_{0}\in \Omega$ there exists a unique conformal map $F:\Omega \to \DD$ such that $F(z_{0}) = 0$ and $F'(z_{0}) > 0$.

Thus any two such sets $\Omega_{1}, \Omega_{2}$ are conformally equivalent.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Riemann's Removable Singularity Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ except possibly at $z_0$ and $f$ is bounded on $\Omega\setminus\theset{z_0}$, then $z_0$ is a removable singularity.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Open Mapping"}
Any holomorphic non-constant map is an open map.

If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega\setminus\theset{z_0}$ where $z_0$ is an essential singularity, then for every $V\subset \Omega\setminus\theset{z_0}$, $f(V)$ is dense in $\CC$.

:::{.theorem title="Continuation Principle / Identity Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on a bounded connected domain $\Omega$ and there exists a sequence $\theset{z_i}$ with a limit point in $\Omega$ such that $f(z_i) = 0$, then $f\equiv 0$ on $\Omega$.

> Two functions agreeing on a set with a limit point are equal on a domain.
