## Basics

:::{.example title="holomorphic vs non-holomorphic"}
\envlist
- $f(z) = {1\over z}$ is holomorphic on $\CC\smz$.
- $f(z) = \bar{z}$ is *not* holomorphic, since $\bar h \over h$ does not converge (but is real differentiable).
:::

:::{.theorem title="Green's Theorem"}
If $\Omega \subseteq \CC$ is bounded with $\bd \Omega$ piecewise smooth and $f, g\in C^1(\bar \Omega)$, then $$\int_{\bd \Omega} f\, dx + g\, dy = \iint_{\Omega} \qty{ \dd{g}{x} - \dd{f}{y} } \, dA.$$
:::

:::{.theorem title="Summation by Parts"}
Define the forward difference operator $\Delta f_k = f_{k+1} - f_k$, then
\[
\sum_{k=m}^n f_k \Delta g_k  + \sum_{k=m}^{n-1} g_{k+1}\Delta f_k = f_n g_{n+1} - f_m g_m
\]

> Note: compare to $\int_a^b f \, dg  + \int_a^b g\, df = f(b) g(b) - f(a) g(a)$.

## Holomorphic and Entire Functions

### Key Theorems

:::{.theorem title="Cauchy's Theorem" ref="CauchyTheorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$, then 
\[  
\int_{\bd \Omega} f(z) \, dz = 0
.\]

> Slogan: closed path integrals of holomorphic functions vanish.

:::

:::{.theorem title="Morera's Theorem" ref="Morera"}
If $f$ is continuous on a domain $\Omega$ and $\int_T f = 0$ for every triangle $T\subset \Omega$, then $f$ is holomorphic.

> Slogan: if every integral along a triangle vanishes, implies holomorphic.

:::

:::{.theorem title="Liouville's Theorem" ref="Liouville"}
If $f$ is entire and bounded, $f$ is constant.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Cauchy Integral Formula" ref="CauchyIntegral"}
Suppose $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$, then 
\[
f(z) = {1 \over 2\pi i} \oint_{\bd \Omega} {f(\xi) \over \xi-z}\,d\xi
\]
and
\[
\dd{^nf }{z^n}(z) = {n! \over 2\pi i} \int_{\bd \Omega} {f(\xi) \over (\xi - z)^{n+1}} \,d\xi
.\]

### Others

:::{.proposition title="Holomorphic functions have harmonic components"}
If $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$ is holomorphic, then $u, v$ are harmonic.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Holomorphic functions are continuous."}
$f$ is holomorphic at $z_0$ iff there exists an $a\in \CC$ such that
\[  
f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0) - ah = h \psi(h), \quad \psi(h) \converges{h\to 0}\to 0
.\]
In this case, $a = f'(z_0)$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Cauchy-Riemann implies holomorphic"}
If $f = u+iv$ with $u, v\in C^1(\RR)$ satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations on $\Omega$, then $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ and $f'(z) = \dd{f}{z} = {1 \over 2} \qty{\dd{}{x} + {1\over i} \dd{}{y}}f$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Polar Cauchy-Riemann equations"}
\[  
\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}=\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial v}{\partial \theta} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial r}
.\]

## Series and Analytic Functions

:::{.proposition title="Power Series are Smooth"}
Any power series is smooth and its derivatives can be obtained using term-by-term differentiation.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Uniform Convergence of Series"}
A series of functions $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)$ converges uniformly iff 
\[  
\lim_{n\to \infty} \norm{ \sum_{k\geq n} f_k }_\infty = 0
.\]
:::

:::{.theorem title="Weierstrass $M\dash$Test"}
If $\theset{f_n}$ with $f_n: \Omega \to \CC$ and there exists a sequence $\theset{M_n}$ with $\norm{f_n}_\infty \leq M_n$ and $\sum_{n\in \NN} M_n < \infty$, then $f(x) \definedas \sum_{n\in \NN} f_n(x)$ converges absolutely and uniformly on $\Omega$.

Moreover, if the $f_n$ are continuous, by the uniform limit theorem, $f$ is again continuous.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Exponential is uniformly convergent in discs"}
$f(z) = e^z$ is uniformly convergent in any disc in $\CC$.
:::

:::{.proof}
Apply the estimate
\[  
\abs{e^z} \leq \sum {\abs {z}^n \over n!} = e^{\abs{z}}
.\]
Now by the $M\dash$test, 
\[  
\abs{z} \leq R < \infty \implies \abs{\sum {z^n \over n!}} \leq e^R < \infty
.\]
:::

:::{.proposition title="Checking radius of convergence"}
For a power series $f(z) = \sum a_n z^n$, define $R$ by
\[  
{1\over R}\definedas \limsup \abs{a_n}^{1\over n}
.\]

Then $f$ converges absolutely on $\abs{z} < R$ and diverges on $\abs{z} > R$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Maximum Modulus" ref="MaximumModulus"}
If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant on an open region $\Omega$, then $\abs{f}$ can not attain a maximum on $\Omega$.
If $\Omega$ is bounded and $f$ is continuous on $\bar \Omega$, then $\max_{\bar \Omega} \abs{f}$ occurs on $\bd \Omega$.
Conversely, if $f$ attains a local maximum at $z_0 \in \Omega$, then $f$ is constant on $\Omega$.

## Others

:::{.theorem title="Casorati-Weierstrass" ref="Casorati"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega\setminus\theset{z_0}$ where $z_0$ is an essential singularity, then for every $V\subset \Omega\setminus\theset{z_0}$, $f(V)$ is dense in $\CC$.

> The image of a disc punctured at an essential singularity is dense in $\CC$.

:::

:::{.theorem title="Little Picard"}
If $f:\CC\to \CC$ is entire and nonconstant, then $\im(f)$ is either $\CC$ or $\CC\sm\ts{z_0}$ for some point $z_0$.

:::{.theorem title="Continuation Principle / Identity Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on a bounded connected domain $\Omega$ and there exists a sequence $\theset{z_i}$ with a limit point in $\Omega$ such that $f(z_i) = 0$, then $f\equiv 0$ on $\Omega$.

> Two functions agreeing on a set with a limit point are equal on a domain.
