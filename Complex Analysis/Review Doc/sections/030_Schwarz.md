# Schwarz Reflection

:::{.remark}
$\HH^+, \HH^-$ can be replaced with any region symmetric about a line segment $L\subseteq \RR$.

:::{.theorem title="Schwarz Reflection " ref="SchwarzReflection"}
If $f$ is continuous and holomorphic on $\HH^+$ and real-valued on $\RR$, then the extension defined by $F(z) = \bar{f(\bar{z})}$ for $z\in \HH^-$ is a well-defined holomorphic function on $\CC$.
