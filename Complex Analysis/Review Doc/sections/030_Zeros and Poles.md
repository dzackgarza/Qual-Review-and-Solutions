# Zeros and Poles

## Singularities

:::{.theorem title="Riemann's Removable Singularity Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ except possibly at $z_0$ and $f$ is bounded on $\Omega\setminus\theset{z_0}$, then $z_0$ is a removable singularity.

## Counting Zeros 

:::{.theorem title="Argument Principle"}
For $f$ meromorphic in $\gamma^\circ$, if $f$ has no poles and is nonvanishing on $\gamma$ then
\[  
\Delta_\gamma \arg f(z) = \int_\gamma {f'(z) \over f(z)} \,dz = 2\pi (Z_f - P_f)
,\]
where $Z_f$ and $P_f$ are the number of zeros and poles respectively enclosed by $\gamma$, counted with multiplicity.

:::{.theorem title="Rouch√©'s Theorem \label{Rouche}"}
If $f, g$ are analytic on a domain $\Omega$ with finitely many zeros in $\Omega$ and $\gamma \subset \Omega$ is a closed curve surrounding each point exactly once, where $\abs{g} < \abs{f}$ on $\gamma$, then $f$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeros.

Alternatively:

Suppose $f = g + h$ with $g \neq 0, \infty$ on $\gamma$ with $\abs g > \abs h$ on $\gamma$.
Then $$\Delta_\gamma \arg(f) = \Delta_\gamma \arg(h)\quad\text{ and } Z_f - P_f = Z_g - P_g.$$

:::{.example}
- Take $P(z) = z^4 + 6z + 3$.
- On $\abs{z} < 2$:
  - Set $f(z) = z^4$ and $g(z) = 6z + 3$, then $\abs{g(z)} \leq 6\abs{z} + 3 = 15 < 16= \abs{f(z)}$.
  - So $P$ has 4 zeros here.
- On $\abs{z} < 1$:
  - Set $f(z) = 6z$ and $g(z) = z^4 + 3$.
  - Check $\abs{g(z)} \leq \abs{z}^4 + 3 = 4 < 6 = \abs{f(z)}$.
  - So $P$ has 1 zero here.
:::

:::{.example}
- Claim: the equation $\alpha z e^z = 1$ where $\abs{\alpha} > e$ has exactly one solution in $\DD$.
- Set $f(z) = \alpha z$ and $g(z) = e^{-z}$.
- Estimate at $\abs{z} =1$ we have $\abs{g} =\abs{e^{-z}} = e^{-\Re(z)} \leq e^1 < \abs{\alpha} = \abs{f(z)}$
- $f$ has one zero at $z_0 = 0$, thus so does $f+g$.
