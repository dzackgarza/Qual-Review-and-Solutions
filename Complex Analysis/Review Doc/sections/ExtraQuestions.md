- Show that if $f$ is holomorphic on $\DD$ then $f$ has a power series expansion that converges uniformly on every compact $K\subset \DD$.
- Show that any holomorphic function $f$ can be uniformly approximated by polynomials.
- Show that if $f$ is holomorphic on a region $\Omega$ and $f'\equiv 0$ on $\Omega$, then $f$ is constant on $\Omega$.
