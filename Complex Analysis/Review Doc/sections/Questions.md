- Prove the triangle inequality
- Prove the reverse triangle inequality
- Show that $\sum z^{k-1}/k$ converges for all $z\in S^1$ except $z=1$.
- What is an example of a noncontinuous limit of continuous functions?
- Show that the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.
- Show that $f$ is holomorphic if and only if $\bar\del f = 0$.
- Show $n^{1\over n} \converges{n\to \infty } \to 1$.
- Show that if $f$ is holomorphic with $f'=0$ on $\Omega$ then $f$ is constant.
- Show that holomorphic implies analytic.
- Use Cauchy's inequality to prove Liouville's theorem


:::{.problem title="?"}
What is a pair of conformal equivalences between $\HH$ and $\DD$?

:::{.solution}
\[
F: HH &\to \DD \\
z & \mapsto {i-z \over i+z}
\\
\\
G: \DD &\to \HH \\
w &\mapsto i{1-w \over 1 + w}
.\]

> Mnemonic: any point in $\HH$ is closer to $i$ than $-i$, so $\abs{F(z)} < 1$.

- Maps $\RR\to S^1\sm\ts{-1}$.
