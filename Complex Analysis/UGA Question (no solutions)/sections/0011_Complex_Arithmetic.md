- $F(0) = w$ and $F(w) = 0$.
- $\abs{z} = 1$ implies $\abs{F(z)} = 1$.

# Holomorphicity

## Spring 2020 HW 1 # 8

Let $f(z)$ be analytic in a domain, and prove that $f$ is constant if it satisfies any of the following conditions:

a. $\abs{f(z)}$ is constant.
b. $\Re(f(z))$ is constant.
c. $\arg(f(z))$ is constant.
d. $\bar{f(z)}$ is analytic.

How do you generalize (a) and (b)?

### Spring 20202 HW 2 #  2.6.10

Can every continuous function on $\bar \DD$ be uniformly approximated by polynomials in the variable $z$?

> Hint: compare to Weierstrass for the real interval.


:::{.solution}
No: polynomials are holomorphic and the uniform limit of holomorphic functions is holomorphic.
However, $f(z) \da \bar{z}$ is continuous on $\bar\DD$ but not holomorphic.

### Spring 20202 HW 2 #  2.6.13

Suppose $f$ is analytic, defined on all of $\CC$, and for each $z_0 \in \CC$ there is at least one coefficient in the expansion $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(z-z_0)^n$ is zero.
Prove that $f$ is a polynomial.

> Hint: use the fact that $c_n n! = f^{(n)}(z_0)$ and use a countability argument.


:::{.solution}
The claim is that there is some $N$ such that $\dd{^N f}{z^N} \equiv 0$, making $f$ a polynomial.
If no derivative is identically zero, the following set is countable:
\[
\Union_{n\in \NN} \dd{^n f}{z^n}\inv(0)
.\]
This is because each derivative is analytic and the zeros of an analytic function are countable.
But by hypothesis this set is uncountable.

### Spring 20202 HW 2 #  2.6.14

Suppose that $f$ is holomorphic in an open set containing $\DD$ except for a pole $z_0 \in \bd \DD$.
Let $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ be the power series expansion of $f$ in $\DD$, and show that $\lim \frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = z_0$.

> [Solution](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1358964/show-that-lim-limits-n-fraca-na-n1-z-0?rq=1)

### Spring 20202 HW 2 #  1
Let $a_n\neq 0$ and show that
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty} {\abs{a_{n+1}} \over \abs{a_n}} = L \implies \lim_{n\to\infty} \abs{a_n}^{1\over n} = L
.\]

In particular, this shows that when applicable, the ratio test can be used to calculate the radius of convergence of a power series.

### Spring 20202 HW 2 #  2
Let $f$ be a power series centered at the origin.
Prove that $f$ has a power series expansion about any point in its disc of convergence.


### Spring 20202 HW 2 #  3
Prove the following:

a. $\sum_{n} nz^n$ does not converge at any point of $S^1$

b. $\sum_n {z^n \over n^2}$ converges at every point of $S^1$.

c. $\sum_n {z^n \over n}$ converges at every point of $S^1$ except $z=1$.

### Spring 20202 HW 2 #  5
Assume $f$ is continuous in the region $\theset{x+iy \suchthat x\geq x_0, ~ 0\leq y \leq b}$, and the following limit exists independent of $y$:
\[
\lim_{x\to +\infty}f(x+iy) = A
.\]

Show that if $\gamma_x \definedas \theset{z = x+it \suchthat 0 \leq t \leq b}$, then
\[
\lim_{x\to +\infty} \int_{\gamma_x} f(z) \,dz = iAb
.\]
