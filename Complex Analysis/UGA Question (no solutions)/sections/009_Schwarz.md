# Schwarz Lemma and Reflection Principle (8155i)

## 1 $\work$
Suppose $f:\DD\to\DD$ is analytic and admits a continuous extension $\tilde f: \bar \DD \to \bar \DD$ such that $\abs{z} = 1 \implies \abs{f(z)} = 1$.

### a $\work$
Prove that $f$ is a rational function.

### b $\work$
Suppose that $z=0$ is the unique zero of $f$.
Show that
\[  
\exists n\in \NN, \lambda \in S^1 \qtext{ such that }f(z) = \lambda z^n
.\]

### c $\work$

Suppose that $a_1, \cdots, a_n \in \DD$ are the zeros of $f$ and prove that
\[  
\exists \lambda \in S^1 \qtext{such that} f(z) = \lambda \prod_{j=1}^n {z - a_j \over 1 - \bar{a_j} z}
.\]

## 2 $\work$
Let $\bar B(a, r)$ denote the closed disc of radius $r$ about $a\in \CC$.
Let $f$ be holomorphic on an open set containing $\bar B(a, r)$ and let 
\[  
M \definedas \sup_{z\in \bar B(a, r)} \abs{f(z)}
.\]

Prove that 
\[  
z\in \bar B\qty{a, {r\over 2}},\,z\neq a, \qquad {\abs{ f(z) - f(a)} \over \abs{z-a}} \leq {2M \over r}

\[  
G \definedas \theset{z\in \CC\suchthat \Re(z) > 0, \, \abs{z-1} > 1}
.\]

Find all of the injective conformal maps $G\to \DD$.
These may be expressed as compositions of maps, but explain why this list is complete.

## 4 $\work$
Suppose $f: \HH\union \RR\to \CC$ satisfies the following:

- $f(i) = i$
- $f$ is continuous
- $f$ is analytic on $\HH$
- $f(z) \in \RR \iff z\in \RR$.

Show that $f(\HH)$ is a dense subset of $\HH$.

## 5 $\work$
Suppose $f: \DD\to \HH$ is analytic and satisfies $f(0) = 2$.
Find a sharp upper bound for $\abs{f'(0)}$, and prove it is sharp by example.

## 6 $\work$
Suppose $f:\DD\to\DD$ is analytic, has a single zero of order $k$ at $z=0$, and satsifies $\lim_{\abs z \to 1} \abs{f(z)} = 1$.
Give with proof a formula for $f(z)$.

## 7 $\work$

### a $\work$
State the standard Schwarz reflection principle involving reflection across the real axis.

### b $\work$
Give a linear fractional transformation $T$ mapping $\DD$ to $\HH$.
Let $g(z) = \bar z$, and show
\[  
(T^{-1} \circ g \circ T)(z) = 1/\bar z
.\]

### c $\work$
Suppose that $f$ is holomorphic on $\DD$, continuous on $\bar \DD$, and real on $S^1$.
Show that $f$ must be constant.

## 8 $\work$
Suppose $f, g: \DD\to \Omega$ are holomorphic with $f$ injective and $f(0) = g(0)$.

Show that 
\[  
\Forall 0 < r < 1,\qquad g\qty{\theset{\abs{z} < r}} \subseteq f\qty{\theset{\abs{z} < r}}
.\]

> The first part of this problem asks for a statement of the Schwarz lemma.

## 9 $\work$
Let $S\definedas \theset{z\in \DD\suchthat \Im(z) \geq 0}$.
Suppose $f:S\to \CC$ is continuous on $S$, real on $S\intersect \RR$, and holomorphic on $S^\circ$.

Prove that $f$ is the restriction of a holomorphic function on $\DD$.

## 10 $\work$
Suppose $f:\DD\to \DD$ is analytic.
Prove that 
\[  
\forall a\in \DD, \qquad {\abs{f'(a)} \over 1 - \abs{f(a)}^2 } \leq {1 \over 1 - \abs{a}^2}
.\]

### Tie's Extra Questions: Fall 2009
Let $g$ be analytic for $|z|\leq 1$ and $|g(z)| < 1$ for $|z| = 1$.

1.  Show that $g$ has a unique fixed point in $|z| < 1$.

2.  What happens if we replace $|g(z)| < 1$ with $|g(z)|\leq 1$ for
    $|z|=1$? Give an example if (a) is not true or give an proof
    if (a) is still true.

3.  What happens if we simply assume that $f$ is analytic for
    $|z| < 1$ and $|f(z)| < 1$ for $|z| < 1$? Suppose that $f(z)
    \not\equiv  z$. Can f have more than one fixed point in
    $|z| < 1$?

> Hint: The map $\displaystyle{\psi_{\alpha}(z)=\frac{\alpha-z}{1-\bar{\alpha}z}}$ may be useful.

### Spring 20202 HW 2 #  2.6.15

Suppose $f$ is continuous and nonvanishing on $\bar \DD$, and holomorphic in $\DD$.
Prove that if $\abs{z} = 1 \implies \abs{f(z)} = 1$, then $f$ is constant.

> Hint: Extend $f$ to all of $\CC$ by $f(z) = 1/ \bar{f(1/\bar z)}$ for any $\abs{z} > 1$, and argue as in the Schwarz reflection principle.
