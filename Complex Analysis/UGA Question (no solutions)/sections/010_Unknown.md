Let $f$ be a continuous function in the region
$$
D=\{z\ |  |z|>R, 0\leq \arg Z\leq \theta\}\quad\text{where}\quad 0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi
.$$ If there exists $k$ such that
$\displaystyle{\lim_{z\to\infty} zf(z)=k}$ for $z$ in the region
$D$. 

Show that $$\lim_{R'\to\infty} \int_{L} f(z) dz=i\theta k,$$
where $L$ is the part of the circle $|z|=R'$ which lies in the
region $D$.

If $z\in K$, prove that the function
$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{F(z)}}$ can be represented as a convergent
series with respect to $q$: 
$$
\displaystyle{
\frac{1}{F(z)}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(qf(z))^n}{(z-a)^{n+1}}.}$$


## ?
Show that 
$$
\displaystyle \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{a-1}}{1+x^n} dx=\frac{\pi}{n\sin \frac{a\pi}{n}}
$$ 
using complex analysis, $0< a < n$. 

> Here $n$ is a positive integer.



## ?
Let $f(z)$ be entire and assume that $f(z) \leq M |z|^2$ outside some disk for some constant $M$. 

Show that $f(z)$ is a polynomial in $z$ of degree $\leq 2$.


## ?
Let $a_n(z)$ be an analytic sequence in a domain $D$ such that
$\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n(z)|$ converges uniformly on
bounded and closed sub-regions of $D$. 

Show that $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a'_n(z)|$ converges uniformly on bounded and closed sub-regions of $D$.

Let $f(z)$ be analytic in an open set $\Omega$ except possibly at a point $z_0$ inside $\Omega$. 

Show that if $f(z)$ is bounded in near $z_0$, then $\displaystyle \int_\Delta f(z) dz = 0$ for all triangles $\Delta$ in $\Omega$.

For $s>0$, the **gamma function** is defined by
$\displaystyle{\Gamma(s)=\int_0^{\infty} e^{-t}t^{s-1} dt}$.

1.  Show that the gamma function is analytic in the half-plane
    $\Re (s)>0$, and is still given there by the integral formula
    above.

2.  Apply the formula in the previous question to show that
    $$\Gamma(s)\Gamma(1-s)=\frac{\pi}{\sin \pi s}.$$

> Hint: You may need $\displaystyle{\Gamma(1-s)=t \int_0^{\infty}e^{-vt}(vt)^{-s} dv}$ for $t>0$.
