# Riemann Mapping and Casorati-Weierstrass

### Spring 20202 HW 3 #  4

Let $f$ be non-constant, analytic in $\abs{z} > 0$, where $f(z_n) = 0$
for infinitely many points $z_n$ with $\lim_{n\to\infty} z_n = 0$.

Show that $z=0$ is an essential singularity for $f$.

> Example: $f(z) = \sin(1/z)$.


## 10. 
Let $f: {\mathbb C} \rightarrow {\mathbb C}$ be an injective analytic (also called univalent) function. 
Show that there exist complex numbers $a \neq 0$ and $b$ such that $f(z) = az + b$.

### Tie's Extra Questions: Fall 2009
Let $f: {\mathbb C} \rightarrow {\mathbb C}$ be an injective
analytic (also called *univalent*) function. Show that there exist
complex numbers $a \neq 0$ and $b$ such that $f(z) = az + b$.

### Spring 20202 HW 3 #  3.8.14
Prove that all entire functions that are injective are of the form $f(z) = az + b$ with $a,b\in \CC$ and $a\neq 0$.

> Hint: Apply the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem to $f(1/z)$.
