## 1
Let $x_0 = a, x_1 = b$, and set
\[  
x_n \definedas {x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} \over 2} \quad n\geq 2
.\]

Show that $\theset{x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence and find its limit in terms of $a$ and $b$.

## 2
Suppose $f:\RR\to\RR$ is continuous and $\lim_{x\to \pm \infty} f(x) = 0$.
Prove that $f$ is uniformly continuous.

## 3
Give an example of a function $f:\RR\to \RR$ that is everywhere differentiable but $f'$ is not continuous at 0.

## 4
Suppose $\theset{g_n}$ is a uniformly convergent sequence of functions from $\RR$ to $\RR$ and $f:\RR\to \RR$ is uniformly continuous.
Prove that the sequence $\theset{f\circ g_n}$ is uniformly convergent.

## 5
Let $f$ be differentiable on $[a, b]$.
Say that $f$ is *uniformly differentiable* iff for each $\eps > 0$ there exists a $\delta
