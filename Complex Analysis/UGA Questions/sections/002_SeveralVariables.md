## 1
Is the following function continuous, differentiable, continuously differentiable?
\[  
f: \RR^2 &\to \RR  \\
f(x, y) &= 
\begin{cases}
{xy \over \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} & (x, y) \neq (0, 0) \\
0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}
\]

### a 
Complete this definition: "$f: \RR^n\to \RR^m$ is real-differentiable a point $p\in \RR^n$ iff there exists a linear transformation..."

### b
Give an example of a function $f:\RR^2\to \RR$ whose first-order partial derivatives exist everywhere but $f$ is not differentiable at $(0, 0)$.

### c
Give an example ofa function $f: \RR^2 \to \RR$ which is real-differentiable
