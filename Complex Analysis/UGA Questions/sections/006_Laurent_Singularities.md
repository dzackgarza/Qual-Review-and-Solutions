# Laurent Expansions and Singularities (8155f)

## 1 
Find the Laurent expansion of
\[
f(z) = {z + 1 \over z(z-1)}
\]

about $z=0$ and $z=1$ respectively.

## 2

Find the Laurent expansions about $z=0$ of the following functions:
\[
\exp{1\over z} \hspace{8em} \cos \qty{1\over z}
.\]

## 3

Find the Laurent expansion of 
\[
f(z) = {z+1 \over z(z-1)^2}
\]
about $z=0$ and $z=1$ respectively.

> Hint: recall that power series can be differentiated.

## 4

For the following functions, find the Laurent series about $0$ and classify their singularities there:
\[
{\sin^2(z) \over z} \\
z \exp{1\over z^2} \\
{1 \over z(4-z)}
.\]

## 5

Find all entire functions with have poles at $\infty$.

## 6

Find all functions on the Riemann sphere that have a simple pole at $z=2$ and a double pole at $z=\infty$, but are analytic elsewhere.

## 7
Let $f$ be entire, and discuss (with proofs and examples) the types of singularities $f$ might have (removable, pole, or essential) at $z=\infty$ in the following cases:

1. $f$ has at most finitely many zeros in $\CC$.
2. $f$ has infinitely many zeros in $\CC$.

## 8
Define
\[
f(z) &= {\pi^2 \over \sin^2 \qty{\pi z} } \\
g(z) &= \sum_{n\in \ZZ} {1\over (z-n)^2}
.\]

a. Show that $f$ and $g$ have the same singularities in $\CC$.
b. Show that $f$ and $g$ have the same singular parts at each of their singularities.
c. Show that $f, g$ each have period one and approach zero uniformly on $0\leq x \leq 1$ as $\abs{y}\to \infty$.
d. Conclude that $f = g$.
