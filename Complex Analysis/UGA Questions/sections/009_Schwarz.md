# Schwarz Lemma and Reflection Principle (8155i)

## 1
Suppose $f:\DD\to\DD$ is analytic and admits a continuous extension $\tilde f: \bar \DD \to \bar \DD$ such that $\abs{z} = 1 \implies \abs{f(z)} = 1$.

### a
Prove that $f$ is a rational function.

### b
Suppose that $z=0$ is the unique zero of $f$.
Show that there is some $\lambda \in \CC$
