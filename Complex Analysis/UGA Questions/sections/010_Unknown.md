Let $f$ be a continuous function in the region
$$
D=\{z\ |  |z|>R, 0\leq \arg Z\leq \theta\}\quad\text{where}\quad 0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi
.$$ If there exists $k$ such that
$\displaystyle{\lim_{z\to\infty} zf(z)=k}$ for $z$ in the region
$D$. 

Show that $$\lim_{R'\to\infty} \int_{L} f(z) dz=i\theta k,$$
where $L$ is the part of the circle $|z|=R'$ which lies in the
region $D$.

If $z\in K$, prove that the function
$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{F(z)}}$ can be represented as a convergent
series with respect to $q$: 
$$
\displaystyle{
\frac{1}{F(z)}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(qf(z))^n}{(z-a)^{n+1}}.}$$


## ?
Show that 
$$
\displaystyle \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{a-1}}{1+x^n} dx=\frac{\pi}{n\sin \frac{a\pi}{n}}
$$ 
using complex analysis, $0< a < n$. 

> Here $n$ is a positive integer.


## 11. 
Let $g$ be analytic for $|z|\leq 1$ and $|g(z)| < 1$ for $|z| = 1$.

### a   
Show that $g$ has a unique fixed point in $|z| < 1$.

### b  
What happens if we replace $|g(z)| < 1$ with $|g(z)|\leq 1$ for $|z|=1$? 

Give an example if (a) is not true or give an proof if (a) is still true.


### c
What happens if we simply assume that $f$ is analytic for
$|z| < 1$ and $|f(z)| < 1$ for $|z| < 1$? 
Suppose that $f(z)\not\equiv  z$. 

Can $f$ have more than one fixed point in$|z| < 1$?

> Hint: The map $$\displaystyle{\psi_{\alpha}(z)=\frac{\alpha-z}{1-\bar{\alpha}z}}$$ may be useful.


## ?
Let $f(z)$ be entire and assume that $f(z) \leq M |z|^2$ outside some disk for some constant $M$. 

Show that $f(z)$ is a polynomial in $z$ of degree $\leq 2$.


## ?
Let $a_n(z)$ be an analytic sequence in a domain $D$ such that
$\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n(z)|$ converges uniformly on
bounded and closed sub-regions of $D$. 

Show that $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a'_n(z)|$ converges uniformly on bounded and closed sub-regions of $D$.


## 16
Let $f(z)$ be analytic in an open set $\Omega$ except possibly at a point $z_0$ inside $\Omega$. 

Show that if $f(z)$ is bounded in near $z_0$, then $\displaystyle \int_\Delta f(z) dz = 0$ for all triangles $\Delta$ in $\Omega$.
