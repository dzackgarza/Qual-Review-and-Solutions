# Integrals and Cauchy's Theorem

## 1

Suppose $f, g: [0, 1] \to \RR$ where $f$ is Riemann integrable and for $x, y\in [0, 1]$,
\begin{align*}
\abs{g(x) - g(y)} \leq \abs{f(x) - f(y)}
.\end{align*}

Prove that $g$ is Riemann integrable.

## 2

State and prove Green's Theorem for rectangles.

Then use it to prove Cauchy's Theory for functions that are analytic in a rectangle.


## 3

Suppose $\theset{f_n}_{n\in \NN}$ is a sequence of analytic functions on $\DD^\circ \definedas \theset{z\in \CC \suchthat \abs{z} < 1}$.

Show that if $f_n\to g$ for some $g: \DD^\circ \to \CC$ uniformly on every compact $K\subset \DD^\circ$, then $g$ is analytic on $\DD^\circ$.
