## Problems From Tie

### 1

Problem
: Prove that if $f$ has two Laurent series expansions,
  $$
  \begin{aligned} f(z) = \sum c_n(z-a)^n \quad\text{and}\quad f(z) = \sum c_n'(z-a)^n\end{aligned}
  $$
  then $c_n = c_n'$.

### 2

Problem
: Find Laurent series expansions of
  $$\begin{aligned}\frac{1}{1-z^2} + \frac{1}{3-z}\end{aligned}$$
  How many such expansions are there? In what domains are each valid?

### 3

Problem
: Let $P, Q$ be polynomials with no common zeros. Assume $a$ is a root of
$Q$.
  Find the principal part of $P/Q$ at $z=a$ in terms of $P$ and $Q$ if $a$ is (1) a simple root, and (2) a double root.

### 4

Problem
:   Let $f$ be non-constant, analytic in $\abs{z} > 0$, where $f(z_n) = 0$
for infinitely many points $z_n$ with $\lim_{n\to\infty} z_n = 0$.

    Show that $z=0$ is an essential singularity for $f$.

    > Example: $f(z) = \sin(1/z)$.

### 5

Problem
: Show that if $f$ is entire and $\lim_{z\to\infty}f(z) = \infty$, then
$f$ is a polynomial.

### 6

Problem
:   \hfill
    a. Show that
    $$\begin{aligned}\int_0^{2\pi} \log\abs{1 - e^{i\theta}}~d\theta = 0\end{aligned}$$
    b. Show that this identity is equivalent to SS 3.8.9:
    \begin{align*}
    \int_0^1 \log(\sin(\pi x)) ~dx = -\log 2
    .\end{align*}

### 7

Problem
: Let $0<a<4$ and evaluate $$\begin{aligned}
    \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{\alpha-1}}{1+x^3} ~dx\end{aligned}$$

### 8

Problem
:   Prove the fundamental theorem of Algebra using

    a.  Rouche's Theorem.
    b. The maximum modulus principle.

### 9

Problem
:   Let $f$ be analytic in a region $D$ and $\gamma$ a rectifiable curve in
$D$ with interior in $D$.

    Prove that if $f(z)$ is real for all $z\in \gamma$, then $f$ is constant.

### 10

Problem
: For $a> 0$, evaluate
  $$\begin{aligned} \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{d\theta}{a + \sin^2 \theta}\end{aligned}$$

### 11

Problem
: Find the number of roots of $p(z) = 4z^4 - 6z + 3$ in $\abs{z} < 1$ and
$1 < \abs{z} < 2$ respectively.

### 12

Problem
: Prove that $z^4 + 2z^3 -2z + 10$ has exactly one root in each open
quadrant.

### 13

Problem
: Prove that for $a> 0$, $z\tan z - a$ has only real roots.

### 14

Problem
:   Let $f$ be nonzero, analytic on a bounded region $\Omega$ and continuous
on its closure $\overline \Omega$.

    Show that if $\abs{f(z)} \equiv M$ is constant for $z\in \partial \Omega$, then $f(z) \equiv Me^{i\theta}$ for some real constant $\theta$.
