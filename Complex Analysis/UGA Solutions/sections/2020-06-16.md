Suppose $f$ is analytic on $\Omega \supseteq \DD$ whose power series $\sum a_n z^n$ has radius of convergence 1.

a. Give an example of an $f$ which converges at every point on $S^1$.
b. Give an example of an $f$ which is analytic at $z=1$ but $\sum a_n$ diverges.
c. Prove that $f$ can not be analytic at every point of $S^1$.
