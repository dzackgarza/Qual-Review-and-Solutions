## Liouville. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, Power Series

### 1

Suppose $f$ is analytic on $\Omega \supseteq \DD$ whose power series $\sum a_n z^n$ has radius of convergence 1.

a. Give an example of an $f$ which converges at every point on $S^1$.
b. Give an example of an $f$ which is analytic at $z=1$ but $\sum a_n$ diverges.
c. Prove that $f$ can not be analytic at every point of $S^1$.


Solution:

a. Take $\sum {z^n \over n^2}$; then $\abs{z}\leq 1 \implies \abs{z^n\over n^2} \leq {1\over n^2}$ which is summable, so the series converges for $\abs{z}\leq 1$.

b. Take $\sum {z^n \over n}$; then $z=1$ yields the harmonic series, which diverges.
  For $z\in S^1\setminus\theset{1}$, we have $z = e^{2\pi it}$ for $0<t<2\pi$. 
  So fix $t$.
  
  Toward applying the Dirichlet test, set $a_n = 1/n, b_n = z^n$.
  Then for all $N$,
  \begin{align*}
  \abs{\sum_{n=1}^N b_n}
  = \abs{\sum_{n=1}^N b_n}
  = \abs{\sum_{n=1}^N z^n}
  = \abs{  {z-z^{N+1} \over 1 - z} } 
  \leq {2 \over 1-z} < \infty
  .\end{align*}
  Thus $\sum a_n b_n < \infty$ and $\sum z^n/n$ converges.

Prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: every non-constant polynomial $p(z) = a_nz^n + \cdots + a_0 \in \CC[x]$ has a root in $\CC$.

Solution:

- Strategy: By contradiction with Liouville's Theorem
- Suppose $p$ has no roots
- Claim: $1/p(z)$ is a bounded holomorphic function
  - Holomorphic: clear? Since $p$ has no roots.
  - Bounded: write 
  \begin{align*}
  .\end{align*}
