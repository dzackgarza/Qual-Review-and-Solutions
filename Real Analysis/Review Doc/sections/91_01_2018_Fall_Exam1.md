# Midterm Exam 1 (October 2018)

## Problem 1

Let $E \subseteq \RR^n$ be bounded.
Prove the following are equivalent: 

1. For any \( \epsilon>0 \) there exists and open set \( G \) and a closed set \( F \) such that 
\[
F \subseteq E \subseteq G && m(G\sm F) < \epsilon
.\]

2. There exists a \( G_ \delta \) set $V$ and an \( F_ \sigma \) set $H$ such that 
\[
m(V\sm H) = 0
.\]

## Problem 2

Let \( \ts{ f_k } _{k=1}^{\infty } \) be a sequence of extended real-valued Lebesgue measurable functions.

a. Prove that \( \sup_k f_k \) is a Lebesgue measurable function.

b. Prove that if \( \lim_{k \to \infty } f_k(x) \) exists for every \( x \in \RR^n \) then \( \lim_{k\to \infty } f_k \) is also a measurable function.


## Problem 3

### a

Prove that if \( E \subseteq \RR^n \) is a Lebesgue measurable set, then for any \( h \in \RR \) the set
\[
E+h \da \ts{x + h \st x\in E }
\]
is also Lebesgue measurable and satisfies \( m(E + h) = m(E) \).

### b

Prove that if $f$ is a non-negative measurable function on $\RR^n$ and $h\in \RR^n$ then the function
\[
\tau_h d(x) \da f(x-h)
\]
is a non-negative measurable function and
\[
\int f(x) \dx = \int f(x-h) \dx
.\]


# Problem 4

Let $f: \RR^n\to \RR$ be a Lebesgue measurable function.

a. Prove that for all \( \alpha> 0 \) ,
\[
A_ \alpha  \da \ts{x\in \RR^n \st \abs{ f(x) } > \alpha} \implies m(A_ \alpha) \leq {1\over \alpha} \int \abs{f (x)} \dx
.\]

b. Prove that 
\[
\int \abs{ f(x) } \dx = 0 \iff f = 0 \text{ almost everywhere}
.\]
