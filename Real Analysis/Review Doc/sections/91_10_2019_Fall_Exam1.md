# Practice Exam (November 2014)

## Problem 1

Let $m_*(E)$ denote the Lebesgue outer measure of a set \( E \subseteq \RR^n \).

a. Prove using the definition of Lebesgue outer measure that
\[
m \qty{ \Union_{j=1}^{\infty } E_j  } \leq \sum_{j=1}^{\infty } m_*(E_j) 
.\]

b. Prove that for any \( E \subseteq \RR^n \) and any \( \epsilon> 0 \) there exists an open set $G$ with $E \subseteq G$ and
\[
m_*(E) \leq m_*(G) \leq m_*(E) + \epsilon
.\]

## Problem 2

a. See \cref{equivalence_of_approximating_measures}

b. Let $f_k$ be a sequence of extended real-valued Lebesgue measurable function.

    i. Prove that $\inf_k f_k, \sup_k f_k$ are both Lebesgue measurable function.
    Hint: argue that
\[
\ts{x \st \inf_k f_k(x) < a} = \Union_k \ts{x \st f_k(x) < a}
.\]

    ii. Carefully state Fatou's Lemma and deduce the Monotone Converge Theorem from it.
