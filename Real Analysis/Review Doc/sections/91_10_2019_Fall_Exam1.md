# Practice Exam (November 2014)

## Problem 1

Let $m_*(E)$ denote the Lebesgue outer measure of a set \( E \subseteq \RR^n \).

a. Prove using the definition of Lebesgue outer measure that
\[
m \qty{ \Union_{j=1}^{\infty } E_j  } \leq \sum_{j=1}^{\infty } m_*(E_j) 
.\]

b. Prove that for any \( E \subseteq \RR^n \) and any \( \epsilon> 0 \) there exists an open set $G$ with $E \subseteq G$ and
\[
m_*(E) \leq m_*(G) \leq m_*(E) + \epsilon
.\]

## Problem 2

a. See \cref{equivalence_of_approximating_measures}

b. Let $f_k$ be a sequence of extended real-valued Lebesgue measurable function.

    i. Prove that $\inf_k f_k, \sup_k f_k$ are both Lebesgue measurable function.
    
        *Hint: argue that*
\[
\ts{x \st \inf_k f_k(x) < a} = \Union_k \ts{x \st f_k(x) < a}
.\]

    ii. Carefully state Fatou's Lemma and deduce the Monotone Converge Theorem from it.


## Problem 3

a. Prove that if $f, g\in L^+(\RR)$ then 
\[
\int(f +g) = \int f + \int g
.\]
  Extend this to establish that if $\ts{ f_k} \subseteq L^+(\RR^n)$ then
  \[
  \int \sum_k f_k = \sum_k \int f_k
  .\]


b. Let $\ts{E_j}_{j\in \NN} \subseteq \mathcal{M}(\RR^n)$ with $E_j \nearrow E$. 
  Use the countable additivity of $\mu_f$ on \( \mathcal{M}(\RR^n)  \) established above to show that
  \[
  \mu_f(E) = \lim_{j\to \infty } \mu_f(E_j)
  .\]

## Problem 4

a. Show that $f\in L^1(\RR^n) \implies \abs{f(x)} < \infty$ almost everywhere.

b. Show that if $\ts{f_k} \subseteq L^1(\RR^n)$ with $\sum \norm{f_k}_1 < \infty$ then $\sum f_k$ converges almost everywhere and in $L^1$.

c. Use the Dominated Convergence Theorem to evaluate
\[
\lim_{t\to 0} \int_0^1 {e^{tx^2} - 1 \over t} \dx
.\]
