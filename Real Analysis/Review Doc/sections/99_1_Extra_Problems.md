Continuity

- Show that a continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous.

Integrability

- Show that a bounded function is Lebesgue integrable iff it is measurable.

Fourier Analysis

- Show that if $f\in L^1$ then $\hat f$ is bounded and uniformly continuous. 
- Is it the case that $f\in L^1$ implies $\hat f\in L^1$?
