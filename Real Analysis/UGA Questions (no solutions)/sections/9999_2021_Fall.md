# Fall 2021

## Fall 2021 #1

Let $\left\{x_{n}\right\}_{n-1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of real numbers such that $x_{1}>0$ and
\[
x_{n+1}=1-\left(2+x_{n}\right)^{-1}=\frac{1+x_{n}}{2+x_{n}} \text {. }
\]
Prove that the sequence $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ converges, and find its limit.

## Fall 2021 #2

a.
Let $F \subset \mathbb{R}$ be closed, and define
\[
\delta_{F}(y):=\inf _{x \in F}|x-y| .
\]
For $y \notin F$, show that
\[
\int_{F}|x-y|^{-2} d x \leq \frac{2}{\delta_F(y)},
\]
b.
Let $F \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a closed set whose complement has finite measure, i.e. $m(R \sm F)< \infty$. 
Define the function
\[
I(x):=\int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{\delta_{F}(y)}{|x-y|^{2}} d y
\]
Prove that $I(x)=\infty$ if $x \notin F$, however $I(x)<\infty$ for almost every $x \in F$. 

  > Hint: investigate $\int_{F} I(x) d x$.


## Fall 2021 #3

Recall that a set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is measurable if for every $c>0$ there is an open set $U \subseteq \RR^d$ such that $m^{*}(U \sm E)<\epsilon$.

a.
Prove that if $E$ is measurable then for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists an elementary $\operatorname{set} F$, such that $m(E \Delta F)<\epsilon$. 

  Here $m(E)$ denotes the Lebesgue measure of $E$, a set $F$ is called elementary if it is a finite union of rectangles and $E \Delta F$ denotes the symmetric difference of the sets $E$ and $F$.

b.
Let $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a measurable set, such that $0<m(E)<\infty$. Use part (a) to show that
\[
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{E} \sin (n t) d t=0
\]

## Fall 2021 #4

Let $f$ be a measurable function on $\mathbb{R}$. Show that the graph of $f$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

## Fall 2021 #5


Consider the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}=L^{2}([0,1])$.

a.
Prove that of $E \subset \mathcal{H}$ is closed and convex then $E$ contains an element of smallest norm. 

  > Hint: Show that if $\left\|f_{n}\right\|_{2} \rightarrow \min \left\{f \in E:\|f\|_{2}\right\}$ then $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

b.
Construct a non-empty closed subset $E \subset \mathcal{H}$ which does not contain an element of smallest norm.
