**Preface**

I'd like to extend my gratitude to Peter Woolfitt for supplying many solutions and checking many proofs of the rest in problem sessions.
Many other solutions contain input and ideas from other graduate students and faculty members at UGA, along with questions and answers posted on Math Stack Exchange or Math Overflow.
