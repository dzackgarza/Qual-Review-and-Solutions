## Spring 2020 # 2

Let $m_*$ denote the Lebesgue outer measure on $\RR$.

a. Prove that for every $E\subseteq \RR$ there exists a Borel set $B$ containing $E$ such that
  \[
  m_*(B) = m_*(E)
  .\]

b. Prove that if $E\subseteq \RR$ has the property that
  \[
  m_*(A) = m_*(A\intersect E) + m_*(A\intersect E^c)
  \]
  for every set $A\subseteq \RR$, then there exists a Borel set $B\subseteq \RR$ such that $E = B\setminus N$ with $m_*(N) = 0$.

    Be sure to address the case when $m_*(E) = \infty$.

$$
B \definedas \theset{x\in X \suchthat x\in B_n \text{ for infinitely many } n}.
$$

a. Argue that $B$ is also a $\mathcal{B} \dash$measurable subset of $X$.

b. Prove that if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(B_n) < \infty$ then $\mu(B)= 0$.

c. Prove that if  $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(B_n) = \infty$ **and** the sequence of set complements $\theset{B_n^c}_{n=1}^\infty$ satisfies
$$
\mu\left(\bigcap_{n=k}^{K} B_{n}^{c}\right)=\prod_{n=k}^{K}\left(1-\mu\left(B_{n}\right)\right)
$$
for all positive integers $k$ and $K$ with $k < K$, then $µ(B) = 1$.

> Hint: Use the fact that $1 - x ≤ e^{-x}$ for all $x$.

Let $K$ be the set of numbers in $[0, 1]$ whose decimal expansions do not use the digit $4$.

> We use the convention that when a decimal number ends with 4 but all other digits are
different from 4, we replace the digit $4$ with $399\cdots$. For example, $0.8754 = 0.8753999\cdots$.

Show that $K$ is a compact, nowhere dense set without isolated points, and find the
Lebesgue measure $m(K)$.
