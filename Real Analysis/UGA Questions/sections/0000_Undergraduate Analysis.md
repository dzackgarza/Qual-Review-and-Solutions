# Undergraduate Analysis: Uniform Convergence

## Fall 2018 # 1
Let $f(x) = \frac 1 x$.
Show that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $(1, \infty)$ but not on $(0,\infty)$.


## Fall 2017 # 1
Let 
$$
f(x) = s \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n}}{n !}.
$$

Describe the intervals on which $f$ does and does not converge uniformly.

## Fall 2014 # 1
Let $\theset{f_n}$ be a sequence of continuous functions such that $\sum f_n$ converges uniformly.

Prove that $\sum f_n$ is also continuous.

Prove that if $f: [0, 1] \to \RR$ is continuous then
\[
\lim_{k\to\infty} \int_0^1 kx^{k-1} f(x) \,dx = f(1)
.\]
