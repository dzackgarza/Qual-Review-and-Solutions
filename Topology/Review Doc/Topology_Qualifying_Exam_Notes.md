## Notation

- $A\cross B, \prod X_j$ are direct products.

- $A\oplus B, \bigoplus_j X_j$ are direct sums, the subset of $A\cross B$ where only finitely many terms are nonzero.
  - $\Bbb{Z}^n$ denotes the direct sum of $n$ copies of the group $\Bbb{Z}$.
  - Note that $A \oplus B \injects A\cross B$.

- $A\ast B, \bigast_j X_J$ are free products, $F_n \da \ZZ^{\ast n}$ is the free group on $n$ generators.

  - Note that the abelianization yields $\qty{\bigast_j X_j} = \bigoplus_j X_j$.

# Definitions: Point-Set Topology

## Basics

Definition (Topology)
: Closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.

Definition (Neighborhood)
: A neighborhood of a point $x$ is *any* open set containing $x$.

Definition (Limit Point)
:   For $A\subset X$, $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if every punctured neighborhood $P_x$ of $x$ satisfies $P_x \intersect A \neq \emptyset$, i.e. every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ in some point other than $x$ itself.
    
    Equivalently, $x$ is a limit point of $A$ iff $x\in \cl_X(A\setminus\theset{x})$.

Definition (Closed)
:   There are several characterizations of a closed set:
 
    - Closure of a subspace: $Y\subset X \implies \cl_Y(A) \definedas \cl_X(A)\intersect Y$.
    - A set is closed iff it contains all of its limit points.

Definition (Basis)
: For $X$ a space and $\mcb$ a collection of subsets, $\mcb$ is a *basis* for $(X, \tau_X)$ iff every open $U\in \tau_X$ is a union of elements in $\mcb$.

Definition (Topology Generated by a Basis)
:   For $X$ an arbitrary set, a collection of subsets $\mcb$ is a *basis for $X$* iff $\mcb$ is closed under intersections, and every intersection of basis elements contains another basis element.
    The set of unions of elements in $B$ is a topology and is denoted *the topology generated by $\mcb$*.

Definition (Neighborhood Basis)
: If $p\in X$, a *neighborhood basis* at $p$ is a collection $\mcb_p$ of neighborhoods of $p$ such that if $N_p$ is a neighborhood of $p$, then $N_p \supseteq B$ for at least one $B\in \mcb_p$.

Definition (Cover)
: A collection of subsets $\theset{U_\alpha}$ of $X$ is said to *cover $X$* iff $X = \union_{\alpha} U_\alpha$.
  If $A\subseteq X$ is a subspace, then this collection *covers $A$* iff $A\subseteq \union_{\alpha} U_\alpha$

Definition (Refinement)
: A cover $\mcv \covers X$ is a *refinement* of $\mcu \covers X$ iff for each $V\in \mcv$ there exists a $U\in\mcu$ such that $V\subseteq U$.


## Analysis 

Definition (Dense)
: A subset $Q\subset X$ is dense iff $y\in N_y \subset X \implies N_y \intersect Q \neq \emptyset$ iff $\bar Q = X$.


Definition (Bounded)
: A set $S$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ is *bounded* iff there exists an $m\in \RR$ such that $d(x, y) < m$ for every $x, y\in S$.

Definition (Uniform Continuity)
:   For $f: (X, d_x) \to (Y, d_Y)$ metric spaces,
    \begin{align*}
    \forall \eps > 0, ~\exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } \quad d_X(x_1, x_2) < \delta \implies d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) < \eps
    .\end{align*} 

Definition (Lebesgue number)
:   For $(X, d)$ a compact metric space and $\theset{U_\alpha}\covers X$, there exist $\delta_L > 0$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
    A\subset X, ~ \diam(A) < \delta_L \implies A\subseteq U_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha
    .\end{align*}


## Connectedness

Definition (Connected) 
: There does not exist a disconnecting set $X = A\disjoint B$ such that $\emptyset \neq A, B \subsetneq$, i.e. $X$ is the union of two proper disjoint nonempty sets.
  
  Equivalently, $X$ contains no proper nonempty clopen sets.
  
  > Additional condition for a subspace $Y\subset X$: $\cl_Y(A) \intersect V = A \intersect \cl_Y(B) = \emptyset$.

Definition (Locally Connected)
: A space is *locally connected* at a point $x$ iff $\forall N_x \ni x$, there exists a $U\subset N_x$ containing $x$ that is connected.

Definition (Locally Path-Connected)
: A space is *locally path-connected* if it admits a basis of path-connected open subsets.

Definition (Components)
: Set $x\sim y$ iff there exists a connected set $U\ni x, y$ and take equivalence classes.

Definition (Path Components)
: Set $x\sim y$ iff there exists a path-connected set $U\ni x, y$ and take equivalence classes.

## Compactness

Definition (Compact)
:   A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is **compact** if every open cover has a *finite* subcover.
    
    That is, if $\theset{U_j \suchthat j\in J} \subset \tau$ is a collection of open sets such that $X = \union_{j\in J} U_j$, then there exists a *finite* subset $J' \subset J$ such that $X \subseteq \union_{j\in J'} U_j$.

Definition (Locally Compact)
: A space $X$ is *locally compact* iff every $x\in X$ has a neighborhood contained in a compact subset of $X$.

Definition (Paracompact)
: A topological space $X$ is *paracompact* iff every open cover of $X$ admits an open locally finite refinement.

Definition (Precompact)
: A subset $A\subseteq X$ is *precompact* iff $\cl_X(A)$ is compact.


## Separability

Definition (Locally Finite)
: A collection of subsets $\mcs$ of $X$ is *locally finite* iff each point of $M$ has a neighborhood that intersects at most finitely many elements of $\mcs$.

Definition (Separable)
: A space $X$ is *separable* iff $X$ contains a countable dense subset.

Definition (Hausdorff)
: A topo.ogical space $X$ is *Hausdorff* iff for every $p\neq q \in X$ there exist disjoint open sets $U\ni p$ and $V\ni q$. 

Definition (First Countable)
: A space is *first-countable* iff every point admits a countable neighborhood basis.

Definition (Second Countable)
: A space is *second-countable* iff it admits a countable basis.

## Metric Spaces and Analysis

Theorem (Cantor's Intersection Theorem)
: A bounded collection of nested closed sets $C_1 \supset C_2 \supset \cdots$ in a metric space $X$ is nonempty $\iff X$ is complete.

Theorem (Cantor's Nested Intervals Theorem)
: If $\theset{[a_n, b_n] \suchthat n\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}}$ is a nested sequence of **closed and bounded** intervals, then their intersection is nonempty.
  If $\diam([a_n, b_n]) \converges{n\to\infty}0$, then the intersection contains exactly one point.

Proposition
: A continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous.

Proof
: Take $\theset{B_{\eps \over 2}(y) \suchthat y\in Y}\covers Y$, pull back to an open cover of $X$, has Lebesgue number $\delta_L > 0$, then $x' \in B_{\delta_L}(x) \implies f(x), f(x') \in B_{\eps \over 2}(y)$ for some $y$. 

Corollary
: Lipschitz continuity implies uniform continuity (take $\delta = \eps/C$)

Counterexample to the converse: $f(x) = \sqrt x$ on $[0, 1]$ has unbounded derivative.

Theorem (Extreme Value Theorem)
: For $f:X \to Y$ continuous with $X$ compact and $Y$ ordered in the order topology, there exist points $c, d\in X$ such that $f(x) \in [f(c), f(d)]$ for every $x$.

Theorem
: A metric space $X$ is sequentially compact iff it is complete and totally bounded.

Theorem
: A metric space is totally bounded iff every sequence has a Cauchy subsequence.

Theorem
: A metric space is compact iff it is complete and totally bounded.

Theorem (Baire)
: If $X$ is a complete metric space, then the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense in $X$.



## Connectedness

Theorem (Tube Lemma)
:   \todo[inline]{Todo}

## Compactness

Theorem
: $U\subset X$ a Hausdorff spaces is closed $\iff$ it is compact. 

Theorem
: A closed subset $A$ of a compact set $B$ is compact.

Proof
:   \hfill

    - Let $\theset{A_i} \rightrightarrows A$ be a covering of $A$ by sets open in $A$.
    - Each $A_i = B_i \intersect A$ for some $B_i$ open in $B$ (definition of subspace topology)
    - Define $V = \theset{B_i}$, then $V \rightrightarrows A$ is an open cover.
    - Since $A$ is closed, $W\definedas B\setminus A$ is open
    - Then $V\union W$ is an open cover of $B$, and has a finite subcover $\theset{V_i}$
    - Then $\theset{V_i \intersect A}$ is a finite open cover of $A$.

Theorem
: The continuous image of a compact set is compact.

Theorem
: A closed subset of a Hausdorff space is compact.

Theorem
: A continuous bijection $f: X\to Y$ where $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff is an open map and hence a homeomorphism.

## Separability

Proposition 
: A retract of a Hausdorff/connected/compact space is closed/connected/compact respectively.

Theorem
: Points are closed in $T_1$ spaces.


## Maps and Homeomorphism

Theorem
: A continuous bijective open map is a homeomorphism.

Theorem (Munkres 18.1)
:   For $f:X\to Y$, TFAE:

    - $f$ is continuous
    - $A\subset X \implies f(\cl_X(A)) \subset \cl_X(f(A))$
    - $B$ closed in $Y \implies f\inv(B)$ closed in $X$.
    - For each $x\in X$ and each neighborhood $V \ni f(x)$, there is a neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that $f(U) \subset V$.

Proof
: \todo[inline]{Todo, see Munkres page 104}

Theorem (Lee A.52)
:   If $f:X\to Y$ is continuous where $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then 

    - $f$ is a closed map.
    - If $f$ is surjective, $f$ is a quotient map.
    - If $f$ is injective, $f$ is a topological embedding.
    - If $f$ is bijective, it is a homeomorphism.

# AT Summary

## Different Types of Product/Sum Structures

- Cartesian Product $X\cross Y, \prod_i X_i$
- Direct Sum $X \oplus Y, \bigoplus_i X_i$
- Direct Product $X \ast Y, \ast_i X_i$
  - Element-wise multiplication, allows infinitely many entries
  - $\ast_i X_i= \oplus_i X_i$ for $i < \infty$
- Tensor Product $X \tensor Y, \bigotimes_i X_i, X^{\otimes_i}$

*   For a finite index set $I$, $\prod_I G = \bigoplus_I G$ in $\mathbf{Grp}$, i.e. the finite direct product and finite direct sum coincide. 

    Otherwise, if $I$ is infinite, the direct sum requires cofinitely many zero entries (i.e. finitely many nonzero entries), so here we always use $\prod$. 

    In other words, there is an injective map $$\bigoplus_I G \injects \prod_I G$$ which is an isomorphism when $\abs{I} < \infty$

* The free abelian group of rank $n$: 
  $$
  \ZZ^n \definedas \prod_{i=1}^n \ZZ = \ZZ \times \ZZ \times \ldots \ZZ
  .$$ 
	- $x \in \ZZ^n = \left< a_1, \cdots, a_n\right> \implies x = \sum_n c_i a_i$ for some $c_i \in \ZZ$ , i.e. $a_i$ form a basis.
	- Example: $x = 2a_1 + 4a_2 + a_1 - a_2 = 3a_1 + 3a_2$.

* The **free product** of $n$ free abelian groups:
  $$
  \ZZ^{\ast n} \definedas \Conv_{i=1}^n \ZZ = \ZZ \ast \ZZ \ast \ldots \ZZ
  $$ 
  This is a free *nonabelian* group on $n$ generators.

	- $x \in \ZZ^{\ast n} = \left< a_1, \ldots, a_n\right>$ implies that $x$ is a finite word in the noncommuting symbols $a_i^k$ for $k\in \ZZ$.
	- Example: $x = a_1^2 a_2^4 a_1 a_2^{-2}$

Proposition
:   There are no nontrivial homomorphisms from finite groups into free groups.

    In particular, any homomorphism $\ZZ_n \to \ZZ$ is trivial.

Proof
:   Homomorphisms preserve torsion; the former has $n\dash$torsion while the latter does not.

This is especially useful if you have some $f: A\into B$ and you look at the induced homomorphism $f_*: \pi_1(A) \into \pi_1(B)$. If the former is finite and the latter contains a copy of $\ZZ$, then $f_*$ has to be the trivial map $f_*([\alpha]) = e \in \pi_1(B)$ for every $[\alpha] \in \pi_1(A)$.



## Conventions

- Generally assume spaces are connected.

* $\pi_0(X)$ is the set of path components of $X$, and I write $\pi_0(X) = \ZZ$ if $X$ is path-connected (although it is not a group). 
  Similarly, $H_0(X)$ is a free abelian group on the set of path components of $X$.

* Lists start at entry 1, since all spaces are connected here and thus $\pi_0 = H_0 = \ZZ$. That is,
	* $\pi_*(X) = [\pi_1(X), \pi_2(X), \pi_3(X), \cdots]$
	* $H_*(X) = [H_1(X), H_2(X), H_3(X), \cdots]$



# Definitions: Algebraic Topology


- Acyclic

- Alexander duality

- Basis
	* For an $R\dash$module $M$, a basis $B$ is a linearly independent generating set.

- Boundary

- Boundary of a manifold
	* Points $x\in M^n$ defined by 
	$$
	\del M = \theset{x\in M: H_n(M, M-\theset{x}; \ZZ) = 0}
	$$

- Cap Product
	* Denoting $\Delta^p \mapsvia{\sigma} X \in C_p(X; G)$, a map that sends pairs ($p\dash$chains, $q\dash$cochains) to $(p-q)\dash$chains $\Delta^{p-q} \to X$ by
	$$
	H_p(X; R)\cross H^q(X; R) \mapsvia{\frown} H_{p-q}(X; R)\\
	\sigma \frown \psi = \psi(F_0^q(\sigma))F_q^p(\sigma)
	$$
	where $F_i^j$ is the face operator, which acts on a simplicial map $\sigma$ by restriction to the face spanned by $[v_i \ldots v_j]$, i.e. $F_i^j(\sigma) =\restrictionof{\sigma}{[v_i \ldots v_j]}$.

- Cellular Homology

- CW Cell
	- An $n\dash$cell of $X$, say $e^n$, is the image of a map $\Phi: B^n \to X$. That is, $e^n = \Phi(B^n)$. Attaching an $n\dash$cell to $X$ is equivalent to forming the space $B^n \coprod_f X$ where $f: \del B^n \to X$.
		- A $0\dash$cell is a point.
		- A $1\dash$cell is an interval $[-1, 1] = B^1 \subset \RR^1$. Attaching requires a map from $S^0 =\theset{-1, +1} \to X$
		- A $2\dash$cell is a solid disk $B^2 \subset \RR^2$ in the plane. Attaching requires a map $S^1 \to X$.
		- A $3\dash$cell is a solid ball $B^3 \subset \RR^3$. Attaching requires a map from the sphere $S^2 \to X$.

- Cellular Map
	* A map $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ is said to be cellular if $f(X^{(n)}) \subseteq Y^{(n)}$ where $X^{(n)}$ denotes the $n\dash$ skeleton.

- Chain
	* An element $c \in C_p(X; R)$ can be represented as the singular $p$ simplex $\Delta^p \to X$.

- Chain Homotopy
	* Given two maps between chain complexes $(C_*, \del_C) \mapsvia{f, ~g} (D_*, \del_D)$, a chain homotopy is a family $h_i: C_i \to B_{i+1}$ satisfying $$f_i-g_i = \del_{B, i-1}\circ h_n + h_{i+1}\circ \del_{A, i}$$. 
 
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Chain_homotopy_between_chain_complexes.svg/650px-Chain_homotopy_between_chain_complexes.svg.png)

- Chain Map
	* A map between chain complexes $(C_*, \del_C) \mapsvia{f} (D_*, \del_D)$ is a chain map iff each component $C_i \mapsvia{f_i} D_i$ satisfies 
	$$
	f_{i-1}\circ\del_{C, i} = \del_{D,i} \circ f_i
	$$ 
	(i.e this forms a commuting ladder)

:::{.definition title="Colimit"}

- Exact Functor
	* A functor $T$ is *right exact* if a short exact sequence 
	$$0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$$ 
	yields an exact sequence 
	$$\ldots TA \to TB \to TC \to 0,$$ 
	and is *left exact* if it yields 
	$$0 \to TA \to TB \to TC \to \ldots$$
	Thus a functor is exact iff it is both left and right exact, yielding
	$$
	0 \to TA \to TB \to TC \to 0
	$$
	* Examples:
		* $\wait \tensor_R \wait$ is a right exact bifunctor.

	$$
	obtained by conjugating the cup product with Poincare Duality, i.e. $$\left< \alpha, \beta \right> = [M] \frown ([\alpha]\dual \smile [\beta]\dual)$$

	Then, if $[A], [B]$ are transversely intersecting submanifolds representing $\alpha, \beta$, then $$\left<\alpha, \beta\right> = [A\intersect B]$$.

	If $\hat i = j$ then $\left< \alpha, \beta \right> \in H_0 M = \ZZ$ is the signed number of intersection points.

Facts used to compute the above table:

- $\RR^n$ is a contractible space, and so $[S^m, \RR^n] = 0$ for all $n, m$ which makes its homotopy groups all zero.

- $D(k, \RR^n) = \RR^n - \theset{x_1 \ldots x_k} \homotopic \bigvee_{i=1}^k S^1$ by a deformation retract.

- $S^n \cong B^n / \del B^n$ and employs an attaching map 

  \begin{align*}
  \phi: (D^n, \del D^n) &\to S^n \\ 
  (D^n, \del D^n) &\mapsto (e^n, e^0)
  .\end{align*}

- $B^n \homotopic \RR^n$ by normalizing vectors.

- Use the inclusion $S^n \injects B^{n+1}$ as the attaching map.

- $\CP^1 \cong S^2$.

- $\RP^1 \cong S^1$.

- Use $\left[ \pi_1, \prod \right]= 0$ and the universal cover $\RR^1 \surjects S^1$ to yield the cover $\RR^n \surjects T^n$.

- Take the universal double cover $S^n \surjects^{\times 2} \RP^n$ to get equality in $\pi_{i\geq 2}$.

- Use $\CP^n = S^{2n+1} / S^1$

- Alternatively, the fundamental group is $\ZZ\ast\ZZ/ bab^{-1}a$. Use the fact the $\tilde K = \RR^2$.

- $M \homotopic S^1$ by deformation-retracting onto the center circle.

- $D(1, S^n) \cong \RR^n$ and thus $D(k, S^n) \cong D(k-1, \RR^n) \cong \bigvee^{k-1} S^1$

Theorem (Van Kampen)
:   The pushout is the northwest colimit of the following diagram
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    A \disjoint_Z B   & A \ar[d] \ar[l] \\
    B \ar[u]\ar[r]          & Z \ar[l, "\iota_B"] \ar[u, "\iota_A"]
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    For groups, the pushout is given by the amalgamated free product: if $A = \generators{G_A \suchthat R_A}, B = \generators{G_B \suchthat R_B}$, then $$A \ast_Z B = \generators{G_A, G_B \suchthat R_A, R_B, T}$$ where $T$ is a set of relations given by $$T = \theset{\iota_A(z) \iota_B(z)\inv \suchthat z\in Z}.$$


    Suppose $X = U_1 \union U_2$ such that $U_1\intersect U_2 \neq \emptyset$ is **path connected** (necessary condition).
    Then taking $x_0 \in U\definedas U_1 \intersect U_2$ yields a pushout of fundamental groups

    \begin{align*}
    \pi_1(X; x_0) = \pi_1(U_1;x_0) \ast_{\pi_1(U; x_0)} \pi_1(U_2; x_0)
    .\end{align*}


Theorem (Van Kampen)
:   If $X = U \union V$ where $U, V, U\intersect V$ are all path-connected then

    \begin{align*}
    \pi_1(X) = \pi_1 U \ast_{\pi_1(U \intersect V)} \pi_1 V
    ,\end{align*}

    where the amalgamated product can be computed as follows: 
    If we have presentations

    \begin{align*} 
    \pi_{1}(U, w) &=
    \left\langle u_{1}, \cdots, u_{k} \suchthat \alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{l}\right\rangle \\ 
    \pi_{1}(V, w) &=\left\langle v_{1}, \cdots, v_{m} \suchthat \beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}\right\rangle \\ 
    \pi_{1}(U \cap V, w) &=\left\langle w_{1}, \cdots, w_{p} \suchthat \gamma_{1}, \cdots, \gamma_{q}\right\rangle 
    \end{align*}

    then

    \begin{align*}
    \pi_{1}(X, w) 
    &= \left\langle u_{1}, \cdots, u_{k}, v_{1}, \cdots, v_{m}\right\rangle \\ 
    &\mod 
    \left\langle \alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{l}, \beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}, I\left(w_{1}\right) J\left(w_{1}\right)^{-1}, \cdots, I\left(w_{p}\right) J\left(w_{p}\right)^{-1}\right\rangle \\
    &= \frac{\pi_1(U) \ast \pi_1(B)} {\generators{\theset{I(w_i) J(w_i)\inv \suchthat 1\leq i \leq p}}}
    \end{align*}

    where

    \begin{align*}
    I: \pi_{1}(U \cap V, w) &\rightarrow \pi_{1}(U, w) \\
    J: \pi_{1}(U \cap V, w) &\rightarrow \pi_{1}(V, w)

Theorem (Seifert-van Kampen Theorem)
:   Suppose $X = U_1 \union U_2$ where $U \definedas U_1 \intersect U_2 \neq \emptyset$ is path-connected, and let $\pt \in U$. Then the maps $i_1: U_1 \into X$ and $i_2: U_2 \into X$ induce the following group homomorphisms:

    $$
    i_1^*: \pi_1(U_1 ,\pt) \into \pi_1(X, \pt) \\
    i_2^*: \pi_1(U_2 ,\pt) \into \pi_1(X, \pt)
    $$

    and letting $P = \pi_1(U), \pt$, there is a natural isomorphism

    $$
    \pi_1(X, \pt) \cong \pi_1(U_1, \pt) ~\bigast_P~ \pi_1(U_2, \pt)
    $$
    where $\bigast_P$ is the amalgamated free product over $P$.

Note that the hypothesis that $U\cap V$ is path-connected is necessary: take $S^1$ with $U,V$ neighborhoods of the poles, whose intersection is two disjoint components.

Example (of pushing out with Van Kampen)
:   $A = \ZZ/4\ZZ = \gens{x \suchthat x^4}, B = \ZZ/6\ZZ = \gens{y \suchthat x^6}, Z = \ZZ/2\ZZ = \gens{z \suchthat z^2}$.
  
  Then we can identify $Z$ as a subgroup of $A, B$ using $\iota_A(z) = x^2$ and $\iota_B(z) = y^3$.
  
  So $$A\ast_Z B = \gens{x, y \suchthat x^4, y^6, x^2y^{-3}}$$.

[^pullbacks]: More generally, in $\mathbf{Top}$, we can look at $A \from \pt \to B$ -- then $A\cross B$ is the pullback and $A \vee B$ is the pushout. In this case, homology $h: \mathbf{Top} \to \mathbf{Grp}$ takes pushouts to pullbacks but doesn't behave well with pullbacks. Similarly, while $\pi$ takes pullbacks to pullbacks, it doesn't behave nicely with pushouts.


[^homotopyproduct]: This follows because $X\cross Y \surjects X$ is a fiber bundle, so use LES in homotopy and the fact that $\pi_{i\geq 2} \in \mathbf{Ab}$.

# The Fundamental Group (Unsorted)

## Lemma: The fundamental group of a CW-complex only depends on the 1-skeleton, and $H^k(X)$ only depends on the $k$-skeleton.

## Definition: Homotopy

Let $X, Y$ be topological spaces and $f,g: X \to Y$ continuous maps. Then a *homotopy* from $f$ to $g$ is a continuous function

$F: X \cross I \into Y$

such that

$F(x, 0) = f(x)$ and  $F(x,1) = g(x)$

for all $x\in X$. If such a homotopy exists, we write $f\homotopic g$. This is an equivalence relation on $\text{Hom}(X,Y)$, and the set of such classes is denoted $[X,Y] \definedas \hom (X,Y)/\homotopic$.

## Definition: Nullhomotopic

If $f$ is homotopic to a constant map, say $f: x \mapsto y_0$ for some fixed $y_0 \in Y$, then $f$ is said to be *nullhomotopic*. In other words, if $f:X\into Y$ is nullhomotopic, then there exists a homotopy $H: X\cross I \into Y$ such that $H(x, 0) = f(x)$ and $H(x, 1) = y_0$.

Note that constant maps (or anything homotopic) induce zero homomorphisms.

# Theorem: Any two continuous functions into a convex set are homotopic.

Proof: The linear homotopy. Supposing $X$ is convex, for any two points $x,y\in X$, the line $tx + (1-t)y$ is contained in $X$ for every $t\in[0,1]$.
So let $f, g: Z \into X$ be any continuous functions into $X$. Then define $H: Z \cross I \into X$ by $H(z,t) = tf(z) + (1-t)g(z)$, the linear homotopy between $f,g$. By convexity, the image is contained in $X$ for every $t,z$, so this is a homotopy between $f,g$.

## Definition: Homotopy Equivalence

Let $f: X \to Y$ be a continuous map, then $f$ is said to be a *homotopy equivalence* if there exists a continuous map $g: X \to Y$ such that

$f\circ g \homotopic \id_Y$ and $g\circ f \homotopic \id_X$.

Such a map $g$ is called a homotopy inverse of $f$, the pair of maps is a homotopy equivalence.

If such an $f$ exists, we write $X \homotopic Y$ and say $X$ and $Y$ have the same homotopy type, or that they are homotopy equivalent.

> Note that homotopy equivalence is strictly weaker than homeomorphic equivalence, i.e., $X\cong Y$ implies $X \homotopic Y$ but not necessarily the converse.

## Definition: Contractible

A topological space $X$ is *contractible* if $X$ is homotopy equivalent to a point, i.e. $X \homotopic \theset{x_0}$. This means that there exists a pair of homotopy inverses $f: X \into \theset{x_0}$ and $g:\theset{x_0} \into X$ such that $f\circ g = \id_{\theset{x_0}}$ and $g\circ f = \id_X$.

This is a useful property, because it supplies you with a homotopy.

# Definition: Deformation Retract

Let $X$ be a topological space and $A \subset X$ be a subspace, then a *retraction* of $X$ onto $A$ is a map $r: X\into X$ such that the image of $X$ is $A$ and $r$ restricted to $A$ is the identity map on $A$.

Note that this definition isn't very useful, as every space has at least one retraction - for example, the constant map $r:X \into \theset{x_0}$ for any $x\_0 \in X$.

A *deformation retract* is a homotopy $H:X\cross I \into X$ from the identity on $X$ to the identity on $A$ that fixes $A$ at all times. That is,
$$
H: X\cross I \to X \\
H(x, 0) = \id_X \\
H(x, 1) = \id_A \\
x\in A \implies H(x, t) \in A \quad \forall t
$$

Equivalently, this requires that $\restrictionof{H}{A} = \id_A$

A deformation retract between a space and a subspace is a homotopy equivalence, and further $X\homotopic Y$ iff there is a $Z$ such that both $X$ and $Y$ are deformation retracts of $Z$. Moreover, if $A$ and $B$ both have deformation retracts onto a common space $X$, then $A \homotopic B$.

## Definition: The Fundamental Group / 1st Homotopy Group

Given a pointed space $(X,x_0)$, we define the fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ as follows:

- Take the set $L = \theset{\alpha: S^1\into X \mid \alpha(0) = \alpha(1) = x_0}$.
- Define an equivalence relation $\alpha \sim \beta$ iff there exists a homotopy $H: S^1 \cross I \into X$ such that $H(s, 0) = \alpha(s)$ and $H(s, 1) = \beta(s)$, i.e. if $f\homotopic g$ in $X$.
  - Symmetric:
  - Reflexive:
  - Transitive:
- Define $L/\sim$, which contains elements like $[\alpha]$ and $[\id_{x_0}]$, the equivalence classes of loops after quotienting by this relation.
- Define a product structure: for $[\alpha], [\beta] \in L/\sim$, define $[\alpha][\beta] = [\alpha \cdot \beta]$, where we just need to define a product structure on bona fide loops. Just do this by reparameterizing:
  $(f\cdot g)(s) = \mathbb{1}[s \in \left[0, \frac{1}{2}]\right]f(2s) + \mathbb{1}[s \in \left[\frac{1}{2}, 1]\right]g(2s-1)$
  - Continuous: by the pasting lemma and assumed continuity of $f, g$
  - Well-defined:
- Check that this is actually a group
  - Identity element:
  - Closure:
  - Associativity:
  - Inverses:
- Summary:
  - Elements of the fundamental group are *homotopy classes of loops*.
  - Continuous maps between spaces induce *some* homomorphism on fundamental groups.

# Theorem: $X$ is simply connected iff it has trivial fundamental group.

By definition, $X$ is simply connected iff $X$ is path connected and every loop contracts to a point.

$\Rightarrow$: Suppose $X$ is simply connected. Then every loop in $X$ contracts to a point, so if $\alpha$ is a loop in $X$, $[\alpha] = [\id_{x_0}]$, the identity element of $\pi_1(X)$. But then there is only one element in in this group.

$\Leftarrow$: Suppose $\pi_1(X) = 0$. Then there is just one element in the fundamental group, the identity element, so if $\alpha$ is a loop in $X$ then $[\alpha] = [\id_{x_0}]$. So there is a homotopy taking $\alpha$ to the constant map, which is a contraction of $\alpha$ to a point.

## Useful Facts

- Covering maps inject fundamental groups.
	- If $\tilde X \surjects_p X$ is a covering space, then $\pi_1(\tilde X) \injects \pi_1 (X)$ as a subgroup.
- The preimage of a boundary point under a covering map must also be a boundary point
- An $n\dash$sheeted covering space $\tilde X \surjects X$ satisfies $\chi(\tilde X) = n\chi(X)$ when $\tilde X$ is compact.
- For surfaces, covering spaces satisfy $\Sigma_{ij + 1} \surjects \Sigma_{i+1}$ for some $i, j$.
- $\mathrm{Deck}(\tilde X) \definedas \theset{\varphi \in \hom_{\mathbf{Top}}(\tilde X, \tilde X): p\circ \varphi = p}  \cong \pi_1(X)$
- $\tilde X \surjects_{\times k} X \implies [\pi_1(\tilde X) : \pi_1(X)] = k$ where $k =|p^{-1}(x_0)|$
- Normal subgroups correspond to regular coverings (where automorphisms act freely/transitively, so highly symmetric)

A covering map of a space is a map $p: \tilde X \into X$ such that each open set $U\in X$ pulls back to a disjoint union of open sets (called sheets) in $\tilde X$ (referred to as the covering space). That is, $p^{-1}(U) = \coprod_i V_i \subseteq \tilde X$.

If $\tilde X$is simply connected, it is the universal covering space - that is, for any other covering space $Y$ of $X$, $\tilde X$ is also a cover of $Y$. 
We also have $\text{Aut}(\tilde X) \cong \pi_1(X)$ for universal covers - for other covers, $\text{Aut}(\tilde X) \cong N(\Gamma) / \Gamma$ where $N(\cdot)$ is the normalizer and $\Gamma$ is the set of homotopy classes of loops in $\tilde X$ that are lifted from loops in $X$.

Covering spaces of $X$ are in (contravariant) galois correspondence with subgroups of $\pi_1(X)$, i.e. the covering map induces an injective map on fundamental groups.

The number of sheets of a covering space is equal to $[p^*(\pi_1(\tilde X)): \pi_1(X)]$.

### Example: Covering spaces

Identify $S^1 \subset \CC$, then every map $p_n: S^1 \into S^1$ given by $z\mapsto z^n$ a yields a covering space $\tilde X_n$.
Note the induced map $p_n^*: \pi_1(S^1) \into \pi_1(S^1)$ is given by $[\omega_1] \mapsto [\omega_n] = n[\omega_1]$ and so $p_n^*(\pi_1(S^1)) = \ZZ_n = \text{Aut}(\tilde X_n)$. (This can also be seen the other way, by looking at deck transformations which are rotations of the circle by $2\pi/n$)

The universal cover of $S^1$ is $\RR$; this is an infinitely sheeted cover. The fiber above $x_0$ is equal to $\ZZ$. $A:=B$

The universal cover of $\RP^n$ is $S^n$; this is a two-sheeted cover. The fiber above $x_0$ contains the two antipodal points.

The universal cover of $T = S^1 \cross S^1$ is $\tilde X =\RR \cross \RR$. The fiber above the base point contains every point on the integer lattice $\ZZ \cross \ZZ = \pi_1(T) = \text{Aut}(\tilde X)$

## Theorem: Homotopy Lifting

The setup: given $p: \tilde X \surjects X$ a covering space of $X$, a map $f: Y \into X$, and a homotopy $H: Y\cross I \into X$ such that $f_0 \definedas H(y, 0)$ has a lift $\tilde f_0: Y\into \tilde X$.

Then there is a unique homotopy $\tilde H: Y \cross I \into \tilde X$ satisfying $p\circ \tilde H = H$
In other words, if the $t=0$ portion of a homotopy can be lifted to a cover, the entire homotopy can.

## Theorem: Lifting Criterion

Let $p:\tilde X \surjects X$ be a covering of $X$, and let $f:Y \into X$ be a map. Then there is an induced homomorphism $f^*: \pi_1(Y) \into \pi_1(X)$. There is also an induced map $p^*: \pi_1(\tilde X) \into \pi_1(X)$. We then have the following condition:

There exists a lift $\tilde f: Y \into \tilde X$ satisfying $p\circ\tilde f = f$ iff $f^*(\pi_1(Y)) \subseteq p^*(\pi_1(\tilde X))$, i.e. when the fundamental group of $Y$ injects into the projected fundamental group of the cover.

Note that if $Y$ is simply connected, then $\pi_1(Y) = 0$ and this holds automatically!

Moreover, lifts are *unique* if they agree at a single point.

(Technically you need the base space to be connected and "locally pathwise connected")


## Theorem: Fundamental theorem of covering spaces
For every subgroup $G \leq \pi_1(X)$, there is a corresponding covering space $X_G \surjects X$ such that $\pi_1(X_G) = G$. The universal cover is obtained by taking $G$ to be the trivial group.

Alternative phrasing: there is a contravariant, inclusion-reversing map from subgroups of $\pi_1(X)$ to covering spaces of $X$.


## Theorem: If $Y$ is contractible, every map $f: X \into Y$ is nullhomotopic.

If $Y$ is contractible, then $Y$ has the homotopy type of a point. So there is a homotopy $H: Y\cross I \into Y$ between $\id_Y$ and a constant map $c: y \mapsto y_0$. So construct $H': X\cross I \into Y$ as $H'(x, t) = H(f(x), t)$; then $H'(x, 0) = H(f(x), 0) = (\id_x \circ f)(x) = f(x)$ and $H'(x, 1) = H(f(x), 1) = (c \circ f)(x) = c(y) = y_0$ for some $y$. So $H'$ is a homotopy between $f$ and a constant map, and $f$ is nullhomotopic.

## Theorem: Any map that factors through a contractible space is nullhomotopic.

Suppose we have the following commutative diagram:

Then $f = p \circ \tilde f$. Every map into a contractible space is nullhomotopic, so if $Z$ is contractible, then there is a homotopy $\tilde H: X\cross I \into Z$ from $\tilde f$ to a constant map $c$. But then $p\circ \tilde H: X \cross I \into Y$ is also a homotopy from $f$ to the constant map $p\circ c$.

## Application: Showing when there is no covering map $f: X \into Y$

This can be done by lifting $f$ to $\tilde f: X \into \tilde Y$, the universal cover. If the covering space happens to be contractible, you get that $\tilde f$ is nullhomotopic. So there is a homotopy $\tilde H: X\cross I \into \tilde Y$ - but then $p\circ\tilde H: X \into Y$ descends to a homotopy of $f$. If you leave $f$ arbitrary, this would force $\pi_1(Y) = 0$.

# Definition: Monodromy Action

Given $X$ connected and locally connected, $p:\tilde X \to X$ a covering, and $\alpha$ a loop at $x\in X$, let $\tilde \alpha$ be its lift and $\tilde x\in p^{-1}(x)$ be the lifted point in the fiber above $x$. Then $\alpha$ acts on $\tilde x$ from the right, by the rule $\tilde x \curvearrowleft \alpha = \tilde\alpha(1)$.

Then $\text{stab}(\tilde x) = p_*(\pi_1(\tilde X, \tilde x)) \subseteq \pi_1(X, x)$, and this induces a homomorphism $\pi_1(X, x) \into \text{Aut}(p^{-1}(x))$ which is a permutation of elements in the fiber above $x$.

## Definition: Freely and Properly Discontinuous Group Actions
Todo

## Theorem: If $G$ induces a free and properly discontinuous group action on $X$, then $p: X \rightarrow X/G$ is a covering space

Here $X/G$ denotes $X/\sim$  where $\forall x,y\in X, x\sim y \iff \exists g\in G \mid g.x = y$, i.e. all elements in a single orbit are identified.

### Proof:

Construct a map $\phi: G \rightarrow \pi_1(X/G, G.x_0)$ by $g \mapsto [p \circ \gamma_g]$

where $\gamma_g(0) = x_0$ and $\gamma_g(1) = G.x_0$.

- This is homomorphism:
- This is well-defined:

## Application: Fundamental group of the circle
## Application: Fundamental group of the real projective plane

## Constructing Covering Spaces
For a wedge product $X = \bigvee_i^n \tilde X_i$, the covering space $\tilde X$ is constructed as a tree in which each $\tilde X_i$ is a vertex with one of $i$ colors denoting which space it covers. The neighborhood of each colored vertex has edges corresponding to $\pi_1(X_i)$.

> If X and Y are two reasonable spaces with universal covers $\tilde X$ and $\tilde Y$, there is a nice picture of the universal cover $\widetilde{X\vee Y}$ which has the combinatorial pattern of an infinite tree.
> The tree is bipartite with vertices labeled by the symbols $X$ and $Y$. 
> The edges from an $X$ vertex are bijective correspondence with the fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$, and likewise for $Y$ vertices and $\pi_1(Y)$.
> To make $\widetilde{X\vee Y}$, replace each $X$ vertex by $\tilde X$ and each $Y$ vertex by $\tilde Y$. 
> The base point of $X$ lifts to $\abs{\pi_1(X)}$ points in $\tilde X$, and likewise for $Y$. 
> In $\widetilde{X\vee Y}$, copies of $\tilde X$ are attached to copies of $\tilde Y$ at lifts of base points.

**Example**: $S^1 \vee S^1 \to \ZZ \ast \ZZ$

**Example**: $\RP^2 \vee \RP^2 \to \ZZ_2 \ast \ZZ_2$


**Example**: $\RP^2 \vee T^2 \to \ZZ_2 \ast \ZZ$
![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/XVkDn.png)

## Application: Every subgroup of a free group is free
Idea for a particular case: use the fact that $\pi_1(\bigvee^k S^1) = \ZZ^{\ast k}$, so if $G \leq \ZZ^{\ast k}$ then there is a covering space $X \surjects \bigvee^k S^1$ such that $\pi_1(X) = G$. Since $X$ can be explicitly constructed as a graph, i.e. a CW complex with only a 1-skeleton, $\pi_1(X)$ is free on its maximal tree. $\qed$

#  CW and Simplicial Complexes

## Useful Facts
- To build a Moore space $M(n, \ZZ_p)$, take $X = S^n$ and attach $e^{n+1}$ via a map $\Phi: S^n = \del B^{n+1}\to X^{(n)} = S^n$ of degree $p$.
	- To obtain $M(n, \prod G_i)$ take the corresponding $\bigvee X_i$
	- Can also use Mayer Veitoris to conclude $H_{n+1}(\Sigma X) = H_n(X)$, and just suspend spaces with known homology.

## Theorem: Van Kampen's Theorem

Claim: If $X = U \union V$ and $U \intersect V$ is nonempty and "nice", then $\pi_1(X) = \pi_1(U) ~\bigast_{\pi_1(U \intersect V)}~ \pi_1(V)$.

### Proof

- Construct a map going backwards
- Show it is surjective
  - "There and back" paths
- Show it is injective
  - Divide $I\times I$ into a grid

## Definition: CW Complex

### Examples

- $\mathbb{RP}^n = e^1 \cup e^2 \cup \cdots \cup e^n$
- $\mathbb{CP}^n =e^2 \cup e^4 \cup \cdots e^{2n}$
- $S^\infty = \varinjlim S^n$

# Definition: The Degree of  Map $S^n \into S^n$

Given any $f: S^n \into S^n$, there are induced maps on homotopy and homology groups. Taking $f^*: H^n(S^n) \into H^n(S^n)$ and identifying $H^n(S^n) \cong \ZZ$, we have $f^*: \ZZ \into \ZZ$. But homomorphisms of this type are entirely determined by their action on generators. So if $f^*(1) = n$, define $n$ to be the degree of $f$.

Properties and examples:

- $\text{deg}~\id_{S^n} = 1$
- $\text{deg} (f\circ g) = \text{deg}~f \cdot \text{deg}~g$
- $\text{deg}~r = -1$ where $r$ is any rotation about a hyperplane, i.e. $r(\thevector{x_1 \cdots x_i \cdots x_n}) = \thevector{x_1 \cdots -x_i \cdots x_n}$.
- The antipodal map on $S^n\subset \RR^{n+1}$ is the composition of $n+1$ reflections, so $\text{deg}~\alpha = (-1)^{n+1}$.

# Definition: Simplicial Complex

Given a simplex $\sigma = [v_1 \cdots v_n]$, define the face map $\del_i:\Delta^n \into \Delta^{n-1}$, where $\del_i\sigma = [v_1 \cdots \hat v_i \cdots v_n]$.

A simplicial complex is a set $K$ satisfying

1. $\sigma \in K \implies \del_i\sigma \in K$
2. $\sigma,\tau\in K \implies \sigma\intersect\tau = \emptyset,~ \del_i\sigma,~\text{or}~\del_i\tau$
   1. This amounts to saying that any collection of $(n-1)$-simplices uniquely determines an $n$-simplex (or its lack thereof), or that that map $\Delta^k \into X$ is a continuous injection from the standard simplex in $\RR^n$.
3. $\abs{K\intersect B_\varepsilon(\sigma)} < \infty$ for every $\sigma\in K$, identifying $\sigma \subseteq \RR^n$.

To write down a simplicial complex, label the vertices with increasing integers. Then each $n$-cell will correspond to a set of $n+1$ of these integers - throw them in a list.

## Examples of Simplicial Complexes

![Torus](figures/1513062466927.png)

![Klein Bottle and $\RP^2$](figures/1513062526623.png)

For counterexamples, note that this fails to be a triangulation of $T$:

![Not a Torus](figures/1513062599096.png)

This fails - for example, the simplex $[1,2,1]$ does not uniquely determine a triangle in the above picture.

## Templates for Triangulation

You can always triangulate a space by triangulating something homeomorphic, so for common spaces you can work with these fundamental domains:

# Homology

## Unsorted

- $H_n(X/A) \cong \tilde H_n(X, A)$ when $A\subset X$ has a neighborhood that deformation retracts onto it.
- $H_n(\bigvee_\alpha X_\alpha) = \bigoplus_\alpha H_n X_\alpha$

- Useful fact: since $\ZZ$ is free, any exact sequence of the form $0 \to \ZZ^n \to A \to \ZZ^m \to 0$ splits and $A\cong \ZZ^{n}\cross \ZZ^m$.

- Useful fact: $\tilde H_*(A\vee B) \cong H_*(A) \times H_*(B)$.

- $H_n(\bigvee_\alpha X_\alpha) = \bigoplus_\alpha H_n X_\alpha$
- $H_n(X, A) \cong H_n(X/A)$
- $H_n(X) = 0 \iff X$ has no $n\dash$cells.
- $C^0 X = \pt \implies d_1: C^1 \to C^0$ is the zero map.
- $H^*(X; \FF) = \hom(H_*(X; \FF),\FF)$ for a field.

- Useful tools:

* $H_k \prod X \neq \prod H_k X$ due to torsion.

## Constructing a CW Complex with Prescribed Homology

- Given $G = \bigoplus G_i$, and want a space such that $H_i X = G$? Construct $X = \bigvee X_i$ and then $H_i (\bigvee X_i) = \bigoplus H_i X_i$. Reduces problem to: given a group $H$, find a space $Y$ such that $H_n(Y) = G$.
  - Attach an $e^n$ to a point to get $H_n = \ZZ$
  - Then attach an $e^{n+1}$ with attaching map of degree $d$ to get $H_n = \ZZ_d$

## Mayer-Vietoris

Theorem (Mayer Vietoris)
:   Let $X = A^\circ \union B^\circ$; then there is a SES of chain complexes
    \begin{align*}
    0 \to C_n(A\intersect B) \mapsvia{x\mapsto (x, -x)} C_n(A) \oplus C_n(B) \mapsvia{(x, y) \mapsto x+y} C_n(A + B) \to 0
    \end{align*}
    
    where $C_n(A+B)$ denotes the chains that are sums of chains in $A$ and chains in $B$.
    This yields a LES in homology:

    \begin{align*}
    \cdots \to H_n(A\intersect B) \mapsvia{x\mapsto (x, -x)} H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B) \mapsvia{(x, y) \mapsto x+y} H_n(X) \to \cdots
    .\end{align*}


Given $A,B \subset X$ such that $A^\circ \cup B^\circ = X$, there is a long exact sequence in homology:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
 &  &  &  & \cdots \arrow[lllldd, out=0, in=-180, "\delta_3"'] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
H_2(A\cap B) \arrow[rr] \arrow[rr, "{(i^*, -j^*)_2}"] &  & H_2 A \oplus H_2 B \arrow[rr, "(l^* - r^*)_2"] &  & H_2 (A\cup B) \arrow[lllldd, "\delta_2"', out=0, in=-180] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
H_1(A\cap B) \arrow[rr, "{(i^*, -j^*)_1}"] &  & H_1 A \oplus H_1 B \arrow[rr, "(l^*-r^*)_1"] &  & H_1 (A\cup B) \arrow[lllldd, "\delta_1"', out=0, in=-180] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
H_0 (A\cap B) \arrow[rr, "{(i^*, -j^*)_0}"] &  & H_0 A \oplus H_0 B \arrow[rr, "(l^* - r^*)_0"] &  & H_0 (A\cup B) \arrow[lllldd, "\delta_0"', out=0, in=-180] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
0 &  &  &  &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}


This is sometimes written in the following compact form:
$$ \cdots  H_n(A \cap B) \xrightarrow{(i^*,~ j^*)} H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B) \xrightarrow{l^* - r^*}  H_n(X) \xrightarrow{\delta} H_{n-1}(A\cap B)\cdots$$

Where

- $i: A\cap B \hookrightarrow A$ induces $i^*: H_*(A\cap B) \to H_*(A)$

- $j: A\cap B \hookrightarrow B$ induces $j^*: H_*(A\cap B) \to H_*(B)$

- $l: A \hookrightarrow A\cup B$ induces $l^*: H_*(A) \to H_*(X)$

- $r: B \hookrightarrow A\cup B$ induces $r^*: H_*(B) \to H_*(X)$

The connecting homomorphisms $\delta_n :H_n(X) \to H_{n-1}(X)$ are defined by taking a class $[\alpha] \in H_n(X)$, writing it as an $n$-cycle $z$, then decomposing $z = \sum c_i$ where each $c_i$ is an $x+y$ chain. Then $\del(c_i) = \del(x+y) = 0$, since the boundary of a cycle is zero, so $\del(x) = -\del(y)$. So then just define $\delta([\alpha]) = [\del x] = [-\del y]$.

Handy mnemonic diagram:
\begin{align*}
\begin{matrix}
 && A\intersect B & \\
&\large\diagup &  & \large\diagdown \\
A\union B & & \large\longleftarrow &  & A \oplus B
\end{matrix}
.\end{align*}

### Application: Isomorphisms in the homology of spheres.

:::{.proposition title="?"}
\[H^i(S^n) \cong H^{i-1}(S^{n-1}).\]
:::

:::{.proof}
Write $X = A \cup B$, the northern and southern hemispheres, so that $A \cap B = S^{n-1}$, the equator. In the LES, we have:

\begin{align*}
H^{i+1}(S^n) \xrightarrow{} H^i(S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{} H^iA \oplus H^i B \xrightarrow{} H^i S^n \xrightarrow{} H^{i-1}(S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{} H^{i-1}A \oplus H^{i-1}B
.\end{align*}

But $A, B$ are contractible, so $H^iA= H^iB = 0$, so we have

\begin{align*}
H^{i+1}(S^n) \xrightarrow{} H^{i}(S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{} 0 \oplus 0 \xrightarrow{}H^i(S^n) \xrightarrow{} H^{i-1}(S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{} 0

In particular, we have the shape $0 \to A \to B \to 0$ in an exact sequence, which is always an isomorphism.

## Cellular Homology

* $S^n$ has the CW complex structure of 2 $k$-cells for each $0\leq k \leq n$.

How to compute:

1. Write cellular complex $$0 \to C^n \to C^{n-1} \to \cdots C^2 \to C^1 \to C^0 \to 0$$
2. Compute differentials $\del_i: C^i \to C^{i-1}$
    3. *Note: if $C^0$ is a point, $\del_1$ is the zero map.*
    4. *Note: $H_n X = 0 \iff C^n = \emptyset$.*
    5. Compute degrees: Use $\del_n(e_i^n) = \sum_i d_i e_i^{n-1}$ where $$d_i = \deg(\text{Attach }e_i^n \to \text{Collapse } X^{n-1}\dash\text{skeleton}),$$ which is a map $S^{n-1} \to S^{n-1}$.
	    1. Alternatively, choose orientations for both spheres. Then pick a point in the target, and look at points in the fiber. Sum them up with a weight of +1 if the orientations match and -1 otherwise.
    6. Note that $\ZZ^m \mapsvia{f} \ZZ^n$ has an $n\times m$ matrix
    7. Row reduce, image is span of rows with pivots. Kernel can be easily found by taking RREF, padding with zeros so matrix is square and has all diagonals, then reading down diagonal - if a zero is encountered on $n$th element, take that column vector as a basis element with $-1$ substituted in for the $n$th entry.
    e.g.
    
    \begin{align*}
    \begin{matrix}
    \mathbf1&2&0&2\\0&0&\mathbf1&-1\\0&0&0&\mathbf0
    \end{matrix} 
    \to
    \begin{matrix}
    \mathbf1&2&0&2\\0&\mathbf0&0&0\\0&0&\mathbf1&-1\\0&0&0&\mathbf0
    \end{matrix}

[^kunneth]: The generalization of Kunneth is as follows: write $\mathcal{P}(n, k)$ be the set of partitions of $n$ into $k$ parts, i.e. $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{P}(n,k) \implies \mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k)$ where $\sum x_i  = n$. Then
$$
H_n\qty{\prod_{j=1}^k X_j} = \bigoplus_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{P}(n,k)} \bigotimes_{i=1}^{k} H_{x_i}(X_i).
$$
[^wedge]: $\bigvee$ is the coproduct in the category $\mathbf{Top}_0$ of pointed topological spaces, and alternatively, $X\vee Y$ is the pushout in $\mathbf{Top}$ of $X \from \pt \to Y$

# Surfaces and Manifolds

## Classification of Surfaces

![Pasting Diagrams for Surfaces](figures/PastingDiagrams.png)

The most common spaces appearing in this theory:

- $\bbm$ the Möbius Strip
- $\SS ^2$, 
- $\TT^2 \definedas  S^1\cross S^1$, 
- $\RP^2$
- $\KK$ the Klein bottle
- $\Sigma_n \definedas \connectsum_{i=1}^n \TT^2$.

:::{.theorem title="Classification of Surfaces"}
The set of surfaces under connect sum forms a monoid with the presentation
\[  
\gens{ \SS^2, \RP^2, \TT \suchthat \SS^2 = 0, 3\RP^2 = \RP^2 + \TT^2}
.\]

Surfaces are classified up to homeomorphism by orientability and $\chi$, or equivalently "genus" 

- In orientable case, actual genus, $g$ equals the number of copies of $\TT^2$.
- In nonorientable case, $k$ equals the number of copies of $\RP^2$.

In each case, there is a formula
\[  
\chi(X) = 
\begin{cases}
2-2g - b & \text{orientable} \\
2 - k & \text{non-orientable}.
\end{cases}

## Manifolds

> To show something is not a manifold, try looking at local homology. Can use point-set style techniques like removing points, i.e. $H_1(X, X-\pt)$; this should essentially always yield $\ZZ$ by excision arguments.

- $M^n$ closed/connected $\implies H_n = \ZZ$ and $\tor(H_{n-1}) = 0$
- 3-manifolds:
  - Orientable: $H_* = (\ZZ, \ZZ^r, \ZZ^r, \ZZ)$
  - Nonorientable: $H_* = (\ZZ, \ZZ^r, \ZZ^{r-1} \oplus \ZZ_2, \ZZ)$


* $H^n(M^n) = \ZZ$ if $M^n$ is orientable and zero if $M^n$ is nonorientable.
* Poincaré Duality: $H_i M^n =\cong H^{n-i} M^n$ iff $M^n$ is closed and orientable.

On the complements of spaces in $\RR^3$:

> My personal crutch is to just think about complements in $S^3$, which are usually easier since knot complements in $S^3$ are always $K(\pi, 1)$s. 
> Now if $K$ is a knot and $X$ is its complement in $S^3$, then you can prove that its complement in $\RR^3$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^2\vee X$

If $M$ is a closed 3-manifold and $K$ is a nullhomologous knot in $M$, then $H_1(X -n(K)) \cong H_1(X) \times \ZZ$ where $n(K)$ is a tubular neighborhood.

:::{.proposition title="Homology of Sphere minus a knot"}
For $M = S^3 \setminus K$, $H_*(M) = [\ZZ, \ZZ, 0, 0, \cdots]$.
:::
:::{.proof}
Apply Mayer-Vietoris, taking $S^3 = n(K) \cup (S^3-K)$, where $n(K) \homotopic S^1$ and $S^3-K \cap n(K) \homotopic T^2$. 
Use the fact that $S^3-K$ is a connected, open 3-manifold, so $H^3(S^3-K) =0$.

:::



- Every $\CC\dash$manifold is canonically orientable.
- If $M^n$ is **closed and connected**, then $H_{\geq n}(X) = 0$ and $M^n$ is orientable iff $H_n(X) = \ZZ$.
- If $M^n$ is a **closed orientable manifold without boundary**, then $H^k(M^n; F) \cong H_{n-k}(M^n; F)$ for a field $F$.
- This is a strict implication, so failure of the RHS implies missing conditions on the LHS.
- The intersection pairing is nondegenerate modulo torsion.
- If $M^n$ is a **closed orientable manifold with boundary** then  $H_k(M^n; \ZZ) \cong H^{n-k}(M^n, \del M^n; \ZZ)$
- $M^n$ closed, connected, and orientable $\implies H_n = \ZZ$ and $\tor(H_{n-1}) = 0$
- $M^n$ closed and $n$ odd implies $\chi(M^n) = 0$.
- Any map $X \to Y$ with $X$ factors through the orientation cover $\tilde Y_o$.
  - If $Y$ is non-orientable, this is a double cover.
- If $n$ is odd, $\chi(M^n) = 0$ by Poincaré Duality.

Let $X = \RR^3 - \Delta^{(1)}$, the complement of the skeleton of regular tetrahedron, and compute $\pi_1(X)$ and $H_*(X)$.

Lay the graph out flat in the plane, then take a maximal tree - these leaves 3 edges, and so $\pi_1(X) = \ZZ^{\ast 3}$.

Moreover $X \homotopic S^1\vee S^1 \vee S^1$ which has only a 1-skeleton, thus $H_*(X) = [\ZZ, \ZZ^3, 0\rightarrow]$.

## 2 

Let $X = S^1 \cross B^2 - L$ where $L$ is two linked solid torii inside a larger solid torus. Compute $H_*(X)$.
?

## 3 

Let $L$ be a 3-manifold with homology $[\ZZ, \ZZ_3, 0, \ZZ, \ldots]$ and let $X = L \cross \Sigma L$. Compute $H_*(X), H^*(X)$.

Useful facts:

- $H_{k}(X\times Y) \cong \bigoplus _{{i+j=k}}H_{i}(X)\otimes H_{j}(Y) \bigoplus_{i+j=k-1}\tor(H_i(X), H_j(Y))$
- $\tilde H_i(\Sigma X) = \tilde H_{i-1}(X)$

We will use the fact that $H_*(\Sigma L) = [\ZZ, \ZZ, \ZZ_3, 0, \ZZ]$.

Represent $H_*(L)$ by $p(x, y) = 1 + yx + x^3$ and $H_*(\Sigma L)$ by $q(x,y) = 1 + x + yx^2 + x^4$, we can extract the free part of $H_*(X)$ by multiplying

$$p(x,y)q(x,y) = 1 + (1+y)x + 2yx^2 + (y^2+1)x^3 + 2x^4 + 2yx^5 + x^7$$

where multiplication corresponds to the tensor product, addition to the direct sum/product.

So the free portion is
$$H_*(X) = [\ZZ, \ZZ\oplus \ZZ_3, \ZZ_3\tensor \ZZ_3, \ZZ \oplus \ZZ_3\tensor \ZZ_3, \ZZ^2, \ZZ_3^2, 0, \ZZ] \\
=[\ZZ, \ZZ\oplus \ZZ_3, \ZZ_3, \ZZ \oplus \ZZ_3, \ZZ^2, \ZZ_3^2, 0, \ZZ]
$$

We can add in the correction from torsion by noting that only terms of the form $\tor(\ZZ_3, \ZZ_3) = \ZZ_3$ survive. These come from the terms $i=1, j=2$, so $i+j=k-1 \implies k = 1+2+1 = 4$ and there is thus an additional torsion term appearing in dimension 4. So we have

$$H_*(X) = [\ZZ, \ZZ\times \ZZ_3, \ZZ_3, \ZZ \times \ZZ_3, \ZZ^2 \times \ZZ_3, \ZZ_3^2, 0, \ZZ] \\ = [\ZZ, \ZZ, 0,\ZZ,\ZZ^2,0,0,\ZZ] \times [0,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3^2,0,0]$$

and $$H^*(X)= [\ZZ, \ZZ, 0,\ZZ,\ZZ^2,0,0,\ZZ] \times [0, 0,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3^2,0] \\ = [\ZZ, \ZZ, \ZZ_3,\ZZ\times \ZZ_3,\ZZ^2\times \ZZ_3,\ZZ_3,\ZZ_3^2,\ZZ].$$

$\qed$

## 4 

Let $M$ be a closed, connected, oriented 4-manifold such that $H_2(M; \ZZ)$ has rank 1. Show that there is not a free $\ZZ_2$ action on $M$.

Useful facts:

- $X \surjects_{\times p} Y$ induces $\chi(X) = p\chi(Y)$
- Moral: always try a simple Euler characteristic argument first!

We know that $H_*(M) = [\ZZ, A, \ZZ \times G, A, \ZZ]$ for some group $A$ and some torsion group $G$. Letting $n=\mathrm{rank}(A)$ and taking the Euler characteristic, we have $\chi(M) = (1)1 + (-1)n + (1)1 + (-1)n + (1)1 = 3-2n$. Note that this is odd for any $n$.

However, a free action of $\ZZ_2 \actson M$ would produce a double covering $M \surjects_{\times 2} M/\ZZ_2$, and multiplicativity of Euler characteristics would force $\chi(M) = 2 \chi(M/\ZZ_2)$ and thus $3-2n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. This would require $3-2n$ to be even, so we have a contradiction. $\qed$

## 5 

Let $X$ be $T^2$ with a 2-cell attached to the interior along a longitude. Compute $\pi_2(X)$.

Useful facts:

- $T^2 = e^0 + e^1_1 + e^1_2 + e^2$ as a CW complex.
- $S^2/(x_0 \sim x_1) \homotopic S^2 \wedge S^1$ when $x_0, x_1$ are two distinct points. (Picture: sphere with a string handle connecting north/south poles.)
- $\pi_{\geq 2}(\tilde X) \cong \pi_{\geq 2}(X)$ for $\tilde X \surjects X$ the universal cover.

Write $T^2 = e^0 + e^1_1 + e^1_2 + e^2$, where the first and second 1-cells denote the longitude and meridian respectively. By symmetry, we could have equivalently attached a disk to the meridian instead of the longitude, filling the center hole in the torus. Contract this disk to a point, then pull it vertically in both directions to obtain $S^2$ with two points identified, which is homotopy-equivalent to $S^2 \vee S_1$.

Take the universal cover, which is $\RR^1 \union_{\ZZ} S^2$ and has the same $\pi_2$. This is homotopy-equivalent to $\bigvee_{i\in \ZZ}S^2$ and so $\pi_2(X) = \prod_{i\in \ZZ} \ZZ$ generated by each distinct copy of $S^2$. (Alternatively written as $\ZZ[t, t^{-1}]$).

Describe all possible covering maps between $S^2, T^2, K$

Useful facts:

1. $\tilde X \surjects X$ induces $\pi_1(\tilde X) \injects \pi_1(X)$
2. $\chi(\tilde X) = n \chi (X)$
3. $\pi_n(X) = [S^n, X]$
4. $Y \to X$ with $\pi_1(Y) = 0$ and $\tilde X \homotopic \pt \implies$ every $Y\mapsvia{f} X$ is nullhomotopic.
5. $\pi_*(T^2) = [\ZZ \ast \ZZ, 0\rightarrow]$
6. $\pi_*(K) = [\ZZ \semidirect_{\ZZ_2} \ZZ, 0\rightarrow]$
7. Universal covers are homeomorphic.
8. $\pi_{\geq 2}(\tilde X) \cong \pi_{\geq 2}(X)$

Spaces

- $S^2 \surjects T^2$
- $S^2 \surjects K$
- $K \surjects S^2$
- $T^2 \surjects S^2$
	- All covered by the fact that 
  $$
    \ZZ = \pi_2(S^2) \neq \pi_2(X) = 0
    $$ 
    for $X = T^2, K$.
- $K \surjects T^2$
	- Doesn't cover, would induce $\pi_1(K) \injects \pi_1(T^2) \implies \ZZ\semidirect \ZZ \injects \ZZ^2$ but this would be a non-abelian subgroup of an abelian group.

## 2

Show that $\ZZ^{\ast 2}$ has subgroups isomorphic to $\ZZ^{\ast n}$ for every $n$.

Facts Used
1. $\pi_1(\bigvee^k S^1) = \ZZ^{\ast k}$
2. $\tilde X \surjects X \implies \pi_1(\tilde X) \injects \pi_1(X)$
3. Every subgroup $G \leq \pi_1(X)$ corresponds to a covering space $X_G \surjects X$
4. $A \subseteq B \implies F(A) \leq F(B)$ for free groups.

It is easier to prove the stronger claim that $\ZZ^\NN \leq \ZZ^{\ast 2}$ (i.e. the free group on countably many generators) and use fact 4 above.

Just take the covering space $\tilde X \surjects S^1 \vee S^1$ defined via the gluing map $\RR \union_{\ZZ} S^1$ which attaches a circle to each integer point, taking 0 as the base point. Then let $a$ denote a translation and $b$ denote traversing a circle, so we have $\pi_1(\tilde X) = \left<\union_{n\in\ZZ}a^nba^{-n}\right>$ which is a free group on countably many generators. Since $\tilde X$ is a covering space, $\pi_1(\tilde X) \injects \pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) = \ZZ^{\ast 2}$. By 4, we can restrict this to $n$ generators for any $n$ to get a subgroup, and $A\leq B \leq C \implies A \leq C$ as groups.

Construct a space having $H_*(X) = [\ZZ, 0, 0, 0, 0, \ZZ_4, 0\rightarrow]$.

Take $X = e^0 \union_{\Phi_1} e^5 \union_{\Phi_2} e^6$, where
\begin{align*}
\Phi_1: \del B^5 = S^4 \mapsvia{z~\mapsto z^0} e^0 \\
\Phi_2: \del B^6 = S^5 \mapsvia{z~\mapsto z^4} e^5
.\end{align*}

where $\deg \Phi_2 = 4$.$\qed$

## 4 

Compute the complement of a knotted solid torus in $S^3$.

Facts used:

- $H_*(T^2) = [\ZZ, \ZZ^2, \ZZ, 0\rightarrow]$
- $N^{(1)} \homotopic S^1$, so $H_{\geq 2}(N) = 0$.
- A SES $0\to A\to B \to F \to 0$ with $F$ free splits.
- $0\to A \to B \mapsvia{\cong} C \to D \to 0$ implies $A = D = 0$.

Let $N$ be the knotted solid torus, so that $\del N = T^2$, and let $X = S^3 - N$. Then

- $S^3 = N \union_{T^2} X$
- $N \cap X = T^2$


and we apply Mayer-Vietoris to $S^3$:

\begin{align*}
4\qquad H_4(T^2) \to H_4(N) \times H_4(X) \to H_4(S^3) \\
3\qquad H_3(T^2) \to H_3(N) \times H_3(X) \to H_3(S^3) \\
2\qquad H_2(T^2) \to H_2(N) \times H_2(X) \to H_2(S^3) \\
1\qquad H_1(T^2) \to H_1(N) \times H_1(X) \to H_1(S^3) \\
0\qquad H_0(T^2) \to H_0(N) \times H_0(X) \to H_0(S^3) \\
.\end{align*}

where we can plug in known information and deduce some maps:

\begin{align}
4\qquad &0 \to &0 \qquad\to &0 \mapsvia{\del_4} \\
3\qquad &0 \to &H_3(X) \qquad\to &\ZZ \mapsvia{\del_3}\\
2\qquad &\ZZ \to &H_2(X) \qquad\to &0 \mapsvia{\del_2}\\
1\qquad &\ZZ^2 \cong &\ZZ \times H_1(X) \qquad\to &0 \mapsvia{\del_1}\\
0\qquad &\ZZ \to &\ZZ \times H_0(X) \qquad\to &\ZZ \to 0 \\
\end{align}


We then deduce:
- $H_0(X) = \ZZ$ by the splitting of the line 0 SES 
  $$
  0 \to \ZZ \to \ZZ \cross H_0(X) \to \ZZ \to 0
  $$ 
  yielding $Z\cross H_0(X) \cong \ZZ \times \ZZ$.
- $H_1(X) = \ZZ$ by the line 1 SES 
  $$
  0 \to \ZZ^2 \to \ZZ \cross H_1(X) \to 0
  $$ 
  which yields an isomorphism.
- $H_2(X) = H_3(X) = 0$ by examining the SES spanning lines 3 and 2: 
  $$
  0 \injects H_3(X) \injects \ZZ \mapsvia{\cong_{\del_3}} \ZZ \surjects H_2(X) \surjects 0
  $$
 	Since $\del_3$ must be an isomorphism, this forces the edge terms to be zero.

$\qed$

## 5 

Compute the homology and cohomology of a closed, connected, oriented 3-manifold $M$ with $\pi_1(M) = \ZZ^{\ast 2}$.

Facts used:
- $M$ closed, connected, oriented $\implies H_i(M)\cong H^{n-i}(M)$
- $H_1(X) = \pi_1(X) / [\pi_1(X), \pi_1(X)]$
- For orientable manifolds $H_n(M^n) = \ZZ$

**Homology**

- Since $M$ is connected, $H_0 = \ZZ$
- Since $\pi_1(M) = \ZZ^{\ast 2}$, $H_1$ is the abelianization and $H_1(X) = \ZZ^2$
- Since $M$ is closed/connected/oriented, Poincare Duality holds and $H_2 = H^{3-2} = H^1 = \mathbf{F} H_1 + \mathbf{T}H_0$ by UCT. Since $H_0=\ZZ$ is torsion-free, we have $H_2(M) = H_1(M) =  \ZZ^2$.
- Since $M$ is an orientable manifold, $H_3(M) = \ZZ$
- So $H_*(M) = [\ZZ, \ZZ^2, \ZZ^2, \ZZ, 0\rightarrow]$

**Cohomology**

- By Poincare Duality, $H^*(M) = \widehat{H_*(M)} = [\ZZ, \ZZ^2, \ZZ^2, \ZZ, 0\rightarrow]$. (Where the hat denotes reversing the list.)

$\qed$

## 6

Compute $\ext(\ZZ \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_3, \ZZ \times \ZZ_4 \times \ZZ_5)$

Facts Used:

1. $\ext(\ZZ, \ZZ_m) = \ZZ_m$
2. $\ext(\ZZ_m, \ZZ) = 0$
3. $\ext(\prod_i A_i, \prod_j B_j) = \prod_i \prod_j \ext(A_i, B_j)$

Break it up into a bigraded complex, take Ext of the pieces, and sum over the complex:
$\ext(\downarrow, \rightarrow)$ | $\ZZ$   | $\ZZ_4$ | $\ZZ_5$
--------------------------------|---------|---------|--------
$\ZZ$                           | 0       | 0       | 0
$\ZZ_2$                         | $\ZZ_2$ | $\ZZ_2$ | 0
$\ZZ_3$                         | $\ZZ_3$ | 0       | 0

So the answer is $\ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_3 = \ZZ_{12}$. 

$\qed$

## 7 

Show there is no homeomorphism $\CP^2\selfmap_f$ such that $f(\CP^1)$ is disjoint from $\CP_1 \subset \CP_2$.

Facts used:

1. Every homeomorphism induces isomorphisms on homotopy/homology/cohomology.
2. $H^*(\CP^2) = \ZZ[\alpha] / (\alpha^2)$ where $\deg \alpha = 2$.
3. $[f(X)] = f_*([X])$
4. $a\dot{} b = 0 \implies a=0~\text{or}~b=0$ (nondegeneracy).

Supposing such a homeomorphism exists, we would have $[\CP^1] \dot{} [f(\CP^1)] = 0$ by the definition of these submanifolds being disjoint.

But $[\CP^1]\dot{}[f(\CP^1)] = [\CP^1]\dot{} f_*([\CP^1])$, where
$$
f_*: H^*(\CP^2) \to H^*(\CP^2)
$$
is the induced map on cohomology.

Since the intersection pairing is nondegenerate, either $[\CP^1] = 0$ or $f_*([\CP^1]) = 0$.

We know that $H^*(\CP^2) = \ZZ[\alpha] / \alpha^2$ where $\alpha = [\CP^1]$, however, so this forces $f_*([\CP^1]) = 0$. But since this was a generator of $H^*$, we have $f_*(H^*(\CP^2)) = 0$, so $f$ is not an isomorphism on cohomology. $\qed$

## 8 

Describe the universal cover of $X = (S^1 \cross S^1) \vee S^2$ and compute $\pi_2(X)$.

Facts used:
- $\pi_{\geq 2}(\tilde X) \cong \pi_{\geq 2}(X)$
- Structure of the universal cover of a wedge product
- $\RR^2 \surjects_p T^2 = S^1 \cross S^1$

$\tilde X = \RR^2 \union_{\ZZ^2} S^2$, so $\pi_2(X) \cong \pi_2(\tilde X) = \prod_{i,j \in \ZZ^2} \ZZ = \ZZ^{\ZZ^2} = \ZZ^{\aleph_0}$.$\qed$

From the LES in homotopy we have

\begin{align}
4\qquad \pi_4(S^3) \to \pi_4(E) \to \pi_4(S^5) \\
3\qquad \pi_3(S^3) \to \pi_3(E) \to \pi_3(S^5) \\
2\qquad \pi_2(S^3) \to \pi_2(E) \to \pi_2(S^5) \\
1\qquad \pi_1(S^3) \to \pi_1(E) \to \pi_1(S^5) \\
0\qquad \pi_0(S^3) \to \pi_0(E) \to \pi_0(S^5) \\
\end{align}


and plugging in known information yields

\begin{align}
4\qquad &\pi_4(S^3) \to &\pi_4(E) \quad \to 0 \\
3\qquad &\ZZ \to &\pi_3(E) \quad\to 0 \\
2\qquad &0 \to &\pi_2(E) \quad\to 0 \\
1\qquad &0 \to &\pi_1(E) \quad\to 0 \\
0\qquad &\ZZ \to &\pi_0(E) \quad\to \ZZ \\
\end{align}


where rows 3 and 4 force $\pi_3(E) \cong \ZZ$, rows 0 and 1 force $\pi_0(E) = \ZZ$, and the remaining rows force $\pi_1(E) = \pi_2(E) = 0$.

By Hurewicz, we thus have $H_3(E) = \pi_3(E) = \ZZ$.

## 1

Let $X$ be the subspace of the unit cube $I^3$ consisting of the union of the 6 faces and the 4 internal diagonals. Compute $\pi_1(X)$.

**Solution**:

## 2

Let $X$ be an arbitrary topological space, and compute $\pi_1(\Sigma X)$.

**Solution**:

Write $\Sigma X = U \union V$ where $U = \Sigma X - (X\cross[0,1/2])$ and $U = \Sigma X - X\cross[1/2, 1])$. Then $U\intersect V = X \cross \{1/2\} \cong X$, so $\pi_1(U\intersect V) =\pi_1(X)$.

But both $U$ and $V$ can be identified by the cone on $X$, given by 
$CX = \frac{X \cross I}{X \cross 1}$, by just rescaling the interval with the maps:

$i_U: U \into CX$ where $(x,s) \mapsto (x, 2s-1)$
(The second component just maps $[1/2, 1] \into [0,1]$. )

$i_V: V \into CX$ where $(x, s) \mapsto (x, 2s)$.
(The second component just maps $[0,1/2] \to [0, 1]$)

But $CX$ is contractible by the homotopy $H:CX \cross I \into CX$ where $H((c,s), t) = (c, s(1-t))$.

So $\pi_1(U) = \pi_1(V) = 0$. 

By Van Kampen, we have $\pi_1(X) = 0 \ast_{\pi_1(X)} 0 = 0.$

## 3

Let $X = S^1 \cross S^1$ and $A\subset X$ be a subspace with $A \cong S^1 \vee S^1$. Show that there is no retraction from $X$ to $A$.

**Solution**: 

We have $\pi_1(S^1 \cross S^1) = \pi_1(S^1) \cross \pi_1(S^1)$ since $S^1$ is path-connected (by a lemma from the problem sets), and this equals $\ZZ \cross \ZZ$.

We also have $\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) = \pi_1(S^1) \ast_{\theset{pt}} \pi_1(S^1)$, which by Van-Kampen is $\ZZ\ast \ZZ$.

Suppose $X$ retracts onto $A$, we can then look at the inclusion $\iota: A \injects X$. The induced homomorphism $\iota_*: \pi_1(A) \injects \pi_1(X)$ is then also injective, so we've produced an injection from $f: \ZZ \ast \ZZ \injects \ZZ \cross \ZZ$.

This is a contradiction, because no such injection can exists. In particular, the commutator $[a,b]$ is nontrivial in the source. But $f(aba^{-1}b^{-1}) = f(a)f(b)f(a)^{-1}f(b)^{-1}$ since $f$ is a homomorphism, but since the target is a commutative group, this has to equal $f(a)f(a)^{-1} f(b)f(b)^{-1} = e$. So there is a non-trivial element in the kernel of $f$, and $f$ can not be injective - a contradiction.

## 4

Show that for every map $f: S^2 \to S^1$, there is a point $x\in S^2$ such that $f(x) = f(-x)$.

**Solution**:

Suppose towards a contradiction that $f$ does not possess this property, so there is no $x\in S^2$ such that $f(x) = f(-x)$. 

Then define $g: S^2 \into S^1$ by $g(x) = {f(x) - f(-x)}$; by assumption, this is a nontrivial map, i.e. $g(x) \neq 0$ for *any* $x\in S^2$.

In particular, $-g(-x) = -{(f(-x) - f(x))} = {f(x) - f(-x)} = g(x)$, so $-g(x) = g(-x)$ and thus $g$ commutes with the antipodal map $\alpha: S^2 \to S^2$. 

This means $g$ is constant on the fibers of the quotient map $p: S^2 \into \RP 2$, and thus descends to a well defined map $\tilde g: \RP 2 \into S^1$, and since $S^1 \cong \RP 1$, we can identify this with a map $\tilde g: \RP 2 \into \RP 1$ which thus induces a homomorphism $\tilde g_*: \pi_1(\RP 2) \to \pi_1(\RP 1)$.

Since $g$ was nontrivial, $\tilde g$ is nontrivial, and by functoriality of $\pi_1$, $\tilde g_*$ is nontrivial.

But $\pi_1(\RP 2) = \ZZ_2$ and $\pi_1(\RP 1) = \ZZ$, and $\tilde g_*: \ZZ^2 \into \ZZ$ can only be the trivial homomorphism - a contradiction.



**Alternate Solution**

Use covering space $\RR \surjects S^1$?

## 5

How many path-connected 2-fold covering spaces does $S^1 \vee \RP 2$ have? What are the total spaces?

**Solution**:

First note that $\pi_1(X) = \pi_1(S^1) \ast_{\pt} \pi_1(\RP 2)$ by Van-Kampen, and this is equal to $\ZZ \ast \ZZ_2$.

## 6

Let $G = <a, b>$ and $H \leq G$ where $H = <aba^{-1}b^{-1},~ a^2ba^{-2}b^{-1},~ a^{-1}bab^{-1},~ aba^{-2}b^{-1}a>$. To what well-known group is $H$ isomorphic?

**Solution**:

## Exact Sequences

The sequence $A \mapsvia{f_1} B \mapsvia{f_2} C$ is exact if and only if $\im f_i = \ker f_{i+1}$ and thus $f_2 \circ f_1 = 0$.

Some useful results:

- $0 \into A \injects_{f} B$ is exact iff $f$ is **injective**
- $B\surjects_{f} C \into 0$ is exact iff $f$ is **surjective**
- $0\into A \into B \into 0$ is exact iff $A \cong B$.
- $A \injects B \to C \to D \surjects E$ iff $C = 0$
- $0\to A \to B \mapsvia{\cong} C \to D\to 0$ iff $A = D = 0$.
	- Todo: Proof
- $0\to A\to B \to C \to 0$ splits iff $C$ is free.

Can think of $C \cong \frac{B}{\im f_1}$.

The sequences *splits* when a morphism $f_2^{-1}: C \into B$ exists. In $\textbf{Ab}$, this means $B \cong A \oplus C$, in $\mathbf{Grp}$ it's $B \cong A \semidirect_\phi C$.

Examples:

- $0 \into \ZZ \mapsvia{\times 2} \ZZ \mapsvia{\text{mod}~2} \frac{\ZZ}{2\ZZ} \into 0$
- $1 \into N \mapsvia{\iota} G \mapsvia{p} \frac{G}{N} \into 1$
  - Groups and normal subgroups
- $1 \into \frac{\ZZ}{n\ZZ} \mapsvia{\iota} D_{2n} \mapsvia{?} \frac{\ZZ}{2\ZZ} \into 1$
  - Dihedral group and cyclic groups
- $0 \into I \intersect J \mapsvia{\Delta: x\mapsto(x,x)} I \oplus J \mapsvia{f:(x,y) \mapsto x-y} I + J \into 0$
  - $R$-Modules
- $0 \into \frac{R}{I \intersect J} \mapsvia{\Delta: x\mapsto(x,x)} \frac{R}{I} \oplus \frac{R}{J} \mapsvia{f:(x,y) \mapsto x-y} \frac{R}{I + J} \into 0$
- $0 \into \mathbb{H}_1 \mapsvia{\nabla} \mathbb{H}_\text{curl} \mapsvia{\nabla \cross} \mathbb{H}_\text{div} \mapsvia{\nabla \cdot} \mathbb{L}_2 \into 0$
  - Since $\nabla \cross \nabla F = \nabla \cdot\nabla\cross \bar{v} = 0$ in Hilbert spaces

:::{.remark}
Is $f_1\circ f_2 = 0$ equivalent to exactness..?
Answer: yes, every exact sequence is a chain complex with trivial homology. 
Therefore homology measures the failure of exactness.

> Alternatively stated: Exact sequences are chain complexes with no cycles.

Any LES $A_1 \into \cdots \into A_6$ decomposes into a twisted collection of SES's; define $C_k = \ker (A_k \into A_{k+1}) \cong \im(A_{k-1} \into A_k)) \cong \coker(A_{k-2} \into A_{k-1})$, then all diagonals here are exact:

## Five Lemma

If $m, p$ are isomorphisms, $l$ is an **surjection**, and $q$ is an **injection**, then $n$ is an **isomorphism**.

![5 lemma.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/5_lemma.svg/388px-5_lemma.svg.png)

Proof: diagram chase two "four lemmas", one on each side. Full proof [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_lemma).
## Free Resolutions

The canonical example:
$$
0 \to \ZZ \mapsvia{\times m} \ZZ \mapsvia{\mod m} \ZZ_m \to 0
$$

Or more generally for a finitely generated group $G = \generators{g_1, g_2, \cdots, g_n}$,
$$
\cdots \to \ker(f) \to F[g_1, g_2, \cdots, g_n] \mapsvia{f} G \to 0
$$ 
where $F$ denotes taking the free group.

Every abelian groups has a resolution of this form and length 2.

## Computing Tor

$$
\tor(A, B) = h[\cdots \to A_n \tensor B \to A_{n-1}\tensor B \to \cdots A_1\tensor B \to 0]
$$ 
where $A_*$ is any free resolution of $A$.

Shorthand/mnemonic: 
$$
\tor: \mathcal{F}(A) \to (\wait \tensor B) \to H_*
$$

## Computing Ext
$$
\ext(A, B) = h[\cdots \hom(A, B_n) \to \hom(A, B_{n-1}) \to \cdots \to \hom(A, B_1) \to 0 ]
$$ 
where $B_*$ is a any free resolution of $B$.

Shorthand/mnemonic: 
$$
\ext: \mathcal{F}(B) \to \hom(A, \wait) \to H_*
$$

- $\ext(\bigoplus_i A_i, \prod_j B_j) = \bigoplus_i \prod_j \ext(\mathbf{T}A_i, B_j)$
- $\ext(F, G) = 0$ if $F$ is free
- $\ext(\ZZ_n, G) \cong G/nG$

## Cap and Cup Products

$$
\cup: H^p \cross H^q \to H^{p+q}; (a^p \cup b^q)(\sigma) = a^p(\sigma \circ F_p) b^q(\sigma \circ B_q)
$$ 
where $F_p, B_q$ is embedding into a $p+q$ simplex.

For $f$ continuous, $f^*(a\cup b) = f^*a \cup f^*b$

It satisfies the Leibniz rule
$$\del(a^p \cup b^q) = \del a^p \cup b^q + (-1)^p(a^p\cup \del b^q)$$ 

$$
\cap: H_p \cross H^q \to H_{p-q}; \sigma \cap \psi = \psi(F\circ\sigma)(B\circ \sigma)
$$ 
where $F,B$ are the front/back face maps.

Given $\psi \in C^q, \phi \in C^p, \sigma: \Delta^{p+q} \to X$, we have
$$
\psi(\sigma \cap \phi) = (\phi \cup \psi)(\sigma)\\
\inner{\phi\cup \psi}{\sigma} = \inner{\psi}{\sigma \cap \phi}
$$

Let $M^n$ be a closed oriented smooth manifold, and $A^{\hat i}, B^{\hat j} \subseteq X$ be submanifolds of codimension $i$ and $j$ respectively that intersect transversely (so $\forall p\in A\intersect B$, the inclusion-induced map $T_pA \times T_p B \to T_p X$ is surjective.)

Then $A\cap B$ is a submanifold of codimension $i+j$ and there is a short exact sequence
$$
0 \to T_p(A\intersect B) \to T_p A \times T_p B \to T_p X \to 0
$$

which determines an orientation on $A\intersect B$.

Then the images under inclusion define homology classes

- $[A] \in H_{\hat i}X$
- $[B] \in H_{\hat j}X$
- $[A\intersect B] \in H_{\widehat{i+j}}X$.

Denoting their Poincare duals by

- $[A]\dual \in H^i X$
- $[B]\dual \in H^j X$
- $[A\intersect B]\dual \in H^{i+j}X$

We then have
$$
[A]\dual \smile [B]\dual = [A\intersect B]\dual \in H^{i+j} X
$$

Example: in $\CP^n$, each even-dimensional cohomology $H^{2i}\CP^n$ has a generator $\alpha_i$ with is Poincare dual to an $\hat i$ plane. A generic $\hat i$ plane intersects a $\hat j$ plane in a $\widehat{i+j}$ plane, yielding $\alpha_i \smile \alpha_j = \alpha_{i+j}$ for $i+j \leq n$.

Example: For $T^2$, we have
- $H_1T^2 = \ZZ^2$ generated by $[A], [B]$, the longitudinal and meridian circles.
- $H_0T^2 = \ZZ$ generated by $[p]$, the class of a point.

Then $A\cap B = \pm [p]$, and so
$$
[A]\dual \smile [B]\dual = [p]\dual\\
[B]\dual \smile [A]\dual = -[p]\dual
$$
