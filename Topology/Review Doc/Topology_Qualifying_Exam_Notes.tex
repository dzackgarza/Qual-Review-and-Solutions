\subsection{Basics}\label{basics}}

\begin{description}
\item[Definition (Topology)]
Closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.
\item[Definition (Neighborhood)]
A neighborhood of a point \(x\) is \emph{any} open set containing \(x\).
\item[Definition (Limit Point)]
For \(A\subset X\), \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) if every punctured
neighborhood \(P_x\) of \(x\) satisfies \(P_x \cap A \neq \emptyset\),
i.e.~every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \(A\) in some point other
than \(x\) itself.

Equivalently, \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) iff
\(x\in \operatorname{cl}_X(A\setminus\left\{{x}\right\})\).
\item[Definition (Closed)]
There are several characterizations of a closed set:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Closure of a subspace:
  \(Y\subset X \implies \operatorname{cl}_Y(A) \coloneqq\operatorname{cl}_X(A)\cap Y\).
\item
  A set is closed iff it contains all of its limit points.
\end{itemize}
\item[Definition (Basis)]
For \(X\) a space and \({\mathcal{B}}\) a collection of subsets,
\({\mathcal{B}}\) is a \emph{basis} for \((X, \tau_X)\) iff every open
\(U\in \tau_X\) is a union of elements in \({\mathcal{B}}\).
\item[Definition (Topology Generated by a Basis)]
For \(X\) an arbitrary set, a collection of subsets \({\mathcal{B}}\) is
a \emph{basis for \(X\)} iff \({\mathcal{B}}\) is closed under
intersections, and every intersection of basis elements contains another
basis element. The set of unions of elements in \(B\) is a topology and
is denoted \emph{the topology generated by \({\mathcal{B}}\)}.
\item[Definition (Neighborhood Basis)]
If \(p\in X\), a \emph{neighborhood basis} at \(p\) is a collection
\({\mathcal{B}}_p\) of neighborhoods of \(p\) such that if \(N_p\) is a
neighborhood of \(p\), then \(N_p \supseteq B\) for at least one
\(B\in {\mathcal{B}}_p\).
\item[Definition (Cover)]
A collection of subsets \(\left\{{U_\alpha}\right\}\) of \(X\) is said
to \emph{cover \(X\)} iff \(X = \cup_{\alpha} U_\alpha\). If
\(A\subseteq X\) is a subspace, then this collection \emph{covers \(A\)}
iff \(A\subseteq \cup_{\alpha} U_\alpha\)
\item[Definition (Refinement)]
A cover \({\mathcal{V}}\rightrightarrows X\) is a \emph{refinement} of
\({\mathcal{U}}\rightrightarrows X\) iff for each \(V\in {\mathcal{V}}\)
there exists a \(U\in{\mathcal{U}}\) such that \(V\subseteq U\).
\end{description}

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Definition (Dense)]
A subset \(Q\subset X\) is dense iff
\(y\in N_y \subset X \implies N_y \cap Q \neq \emptyset\) iff
\(\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muQ\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu = X\).
\item[Definition (Bounded)]
A set \(S\) in a metric space \((X, d)\) is \emph{bounded} iff there
exists an \(m\in {\mathbb{R}}\) such that \(d(x, y) < m\) for every
\(x, y\in S\).
\item[Definition (Uniform Continuity)]
For \(f: (X, d_x) \to (Y, d_Y)\) metric spaces,
\begin{align*} \forall \varepsilon> 0, ~\exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } \quad d_X(x_1, x_2) < \delta \implies d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) < \varepsilon .\end{align*}
\item[Definition (Lebesgue number)]
For \((X, d)\) a compact metric space and
\(\left\{{U_\alpha}\right\}\rightrightarrows X\), there exist
\(\delta_L > 0\) such that
\begin{align*} A\subset X, ~ {\operatorname{diam}}(A) < \delta_L \implies A\subseteq U_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha .\end{align*}
\end{description}

\hypertarget{connectedness}{%
\subsection{Connectedness}\label{connectedness}}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Definition (Connected)]
There does not exist a disconnecting set \(X = A{\coprod}B\) such that
\(\emptyset \neq A, B \subsetneq\), i.e.~\(X\) is the union of two
proper disjoint nonempty sets.
\end{description}

Equivalently, \(X\) contains no proper nonempty clopen sets.

\begin{quote}
Additional condition for a subspace \(Y\subset X\):
\(\operatorname{cl}_Y(A) \cap V = A \cap\operatorname{cl}_Y(B) = \emptyset\).
\end{quote}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Definition (Locally Connected)]
A space is \emph{locally connected} at a point \(x\) iff

that is connected.
\item[Definition (Locally Path-Connected)]
A space is \emph{locally path-connected} if it admits a basis of
path-connected open subsets.
\item[Definition (Components)]
Set \(x\sim y\) iff there exists a connected set \(U\ni x, y\) and take
equivalence classes.
\item[Definition (Path Components)]
Set \(x\sim y\) iff there exists a path-connected set \(U\ni x, y\) and
take equivalence classes.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{compactness}{%
\subsection{Compactness}\label{compactness}}

\begin{description}
\item[Definition (Compact)]
A topological space \((X, \tau)\) is \textbf{compact} if every open
cover has a \emph{finite} subcover.

That is, if
\(\left\{{U_j {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}j\in J}\right\} \subset \tau\) is a
collection of open sets such that \(X = \cup_{j\in J} U_j\), then there
exists a \emph{finite} subset \(J' \subset J\) such that
\(X \subseteq \cup_{j\in J'} U_j\).
\item[Definition (Locally Compact)]
A space \(X\) is \emph{locally compact} iff every \(x\in X\) has a
neighborhood contained in a compact subset of \(X\).

A topological space \(X\) is \emph{paracompact} iff every open cover of
\(X\) admits an open locally finite refinement.
\item[Definition (Precompact)]

subset.
\item[Definition (Hausdorff)]
A topo.ogical space \(X\) is \emph{Hausdorff} iff for every
\(p\neq q \in X\) there exist disjoint open sets \(U\ni p\) and
\(V\ni q\).

neighborhood basis.

\item[Theorem (Cantor's Intersection Theorem)]
A bounded collection of nested closed sets
\(C_1 \supset C_2 \supset \cdots\) in a metric space \(X\) is nonempty
\(\iff X\) is complete.
\item[Theorem (Cantor's Nested Intervals Theorem)]
If
\(\left\{{[a_n, b_n] {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}n\in {\mathbb{Z}}^{\geq 0}}\right\}\)
is a nested sequence of \textbf{closed and bounded} intervals, then
their intersection is nonempty. If

intersection contains exactly one point.
\item[Proposition]
A continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous.
\item[Proof]
Take
\(\left\{{B_{\varepsilon\over 2}(y) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}y\in Y}\right\}\rightrightarrows Y\),
pull back to an open cover of \(X\), has Lebesgue number
\(\delta_L > 0\), then
\(x' \in B_{\delta_L}(x) \implies f(x), f(x') \in B_{\varepsilon\over 2}(y)\)
for some \(y\).
\item[Corollary]
Lipschitz continuity implies uniform continuity (take
\(\delta = \varepsilon/C\))
\end{description}

unbounded derivative.

\begin{description}

For \(f:X \to Y\) continuous with \(X\) compact and \(Y\) ordered in the
order topology, there exist points \(c, d\in X\) such that
\(f(x) \in [f(c), f(d)]\) for every \(x\).
\item[Theorem]
A metric space \(X\) is sequentially compact iff it is complete and
totally bounded.
\item[Theorem]
A metric space is totally bounded iff every sequence has a Cauchy
subsequence.
\item[Theorem]
A metric space is compact iff it is complete and totally bounded.

Structures}\label{different-types-of-productsum-structures}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cartesian Product \(X\times Y, \prod_i X_i\)
\item
  Direct Sum \(X \oplus Y, \bigoplus_i X_i\)
\item
  Direct Product \(X \ast Y, \ast_i X_i\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Element-wise multiplication, allows infinitely many entries
  \item
    \(\ast_i X_i= \oplus_i X_i\) for \(i < \infty\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Tensor Product \(X \otimes Y, \bigotimes_i X_i, X^{\otimes_i}\)
\item
  For a finite index set \(I\), \(\prod_I G = \bigoplus_I G\) in
  \(\mathbf{Grp}\), i.e.~the finite direct product and finite direct sum
  coincide.

  Otherwise, if \(I\) is infinite, the direct sum requires cofinitely
  many zero entries (i.e.~finitely many nonzero entries), so here we
  always use \(\prod\).

  In other words, there is an injective map
  \begin{align*}\bigoplus_I G \hookrightarrow\prod_I G\end{align*}
  which is an isomorphism when
  \({\left\lvert {I} \right\rvert} < \infty\)
\item
  The free abelian group of rank \(n\):
  \begin{align*}
  {\mathbb{Z}}^n \coloneqq\prod_{i=1}^n {\mathbb{Z}}= {\mathbb{Z}}\times {\mathbb{Z}}\times \ldots {\mathbb{Z}}
  .\end{align*}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(x \in {\mathbb{Z}}^n = \left< a_1, \cdots, a_n\right> \implies x = \sum_n c_i a_i\)
    for some \(c_i \in {\mathbb{Z}}\) , i.e.~\(a_i\) form a basis.
  \item
    Example: \(x = 2a_1 + 4a_2 + a_1 - a_2 = 3a_1 + 3a_2\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{free product} of \(n\) free abelian groups:
  \begin{align*}
  {\mathbb{Z}}^{\ast n} \coloneqq\Conv_{i=1}^n {\mathbb{Z}}= {\mathbb{Z}}\ast {\mathbb{Z}}\ast \ldots {\mathbb{Z}}
  \end{align*}
  This is a free \emph{nonabelian} group on \(n\) generators.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(x \in {\mathbb{Z}}^{\ast n} = \left< a_1, \ldots, a_n\right>\)
    implies that \(x\) is a finite word in the noncommuting symbols
    \(a_i^k\) for \(k\in {\mathbb{Z}}\).
  \item
    Example: \(x = a_1^2 a_2^4 a_1 a_2^{-2}\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Proposition]
There are no nontrivial homomorphisms from finite groups into free
groups.

In particular, any homomorphism \({\mathbb{Z}}_n \to {\mathbb{Z}}\) is
trivial.
\item[Proof]
Homomorphisms preserve torsion; the former has \(n{\hbox{-}}\)torsion
while the latter does not.
\end{description}

This is especially useful if you have some \(f: A\to B\) and you look at
the induced homomorphism \(f_*: \pi_1(A) \to\pi_1(B)\). If the former is
finite and the latter contains a copy of \({\mathbb{Z}}\), then \(f_*\)
has to be the trivial map \(f_*([\alpha]) = e \in \pi_1(B)\) for every
\([\alpha] \in \pi_1(A)\).

\hypertarget{conventions}{%
\subsection{Conventions}\label{conventions}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Generally assume spaces are connected.
\item
  \(\pi_0(X)\) is the set of path components of \(X\), and I write
  \(\pi_0(X) = {\mathbb{Z}}\) if \(X\) is path-connected (although it is
  not a group). Similarly, \(H_0(X)\) is a free abelian group on the set
  of path components of \(X\).

Facts used to compute the above table:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \({\mathbb{R}}^n\) is a contractible space, and so
  \([S^m, {\mathbb{R}}^n] = 0\) for all \(n, m\) which makes its
  homotopy groups all zero.
\item
  \(D(k, {\mathbb{R}}^n) = {\mathbb{R}}^n - \left\{{x_1 \ldots x_k}\right\} \simeq\bigvee_{i=1}^k S^1\)
  by a deformation retract.
\item
  \(S^n \cong B^n / {\partial}B^n\) and employs an attaching map

  \begin{align*} \phi: (D^n, {\partial}D^n) &\to S^n \\  (D^n, {\partial}D^n) &\mapsto (e^n, e^0) .\end{align*}
\item
  \(B^n \simeq{\mathbb{R}}^n\) by normalizing vectors.
\item
  Use the inclusion \(S^n \hookrightarrow B^{n+1}\) as the attaching
  map.
\item
  \({\mathbb{CP}}^1 \cong S^2\).
\item
  \({\mathbb{RP}}^1 \cong S^1\).
\item
  Use \(\left[ \pi_1, \prod \right]= 0\) and the universal cover
  \({\mathbb{R}}^1 \twoheadrightarrow S^1\) to yield the cover
  \({\mathbb{R}}^n \twoheadrightarrow T^n\).
\item
  Take the universal double cover
  \(S^n \twoheadrightarrow^{\times 2} {\mathbb{RP}}^n\) to get equality
  in \(\pi_{i\geq 2}\).
\item
  Use \({\mathbb{CP}}^n = S^{2n+1} / S^1\)
\item
  Alternatively, the fundamental group is
  \({\mathbb{Z}}\ast{\mathbb{Z}}/ bab^{-1}a\). Use the fact the
  \(\tilde K = {\mathbb{R}}^2\).
\item
  \(M \simeq S^1\) by deformation-retracting onto the center circle.
\item
  \(D(1, S^n) \cong {\mathbb{R}}^n\) and thus
  \(D(k, S^n) \cong D(k-1, {\mathbb{R}}^n) \cong \bigvee^{k-1} S^1\)

  For a graph \(G\), we always have \(\pi_1(G) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}^n\)

\begin{description}
\item[Theorem (Van Kampen)]
The pushout is the northwest colimit of the following diagram

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
A {\coprod}_Z B   & A \ar[d] \ar[l] \\
B \ar[u]\ar[r]          & Z \ar[l, "\iota_B"] \ar[u, "\iota_A"]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

For groups, the pushout is given by the amalgamated free product: if
\(A = \left\langle{G_A {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}R_A}\right\rangle, B = \left\langle{G_B {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}R_B}\right\rangle\),
then
\begin{align*}A \ast_Z B = \left\langle{G_A, G_B {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}R_A, R_B, T}\right\rangle\end{align*}
where \(T\) is a set of relations given by
\begin{align*}T = \left\{{\iota_A(z) \iota_B(z)^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}z\in Z}\right\}.\end{align*}

Suppose \(X = U_1 \cup U_2\) such that \(U_1\cap U_2 \neq \emptyset\) is
\textbf{path connected} (necessary condition). Then taking
\(x_0 \in U\coloneqq U_1 \cap U_2\) yields a pushout of fundamental
groups

\begin{align*} \pi_1(X; x_0) = \pi_1(U_1;x_0) \ast_{\pi_1(U; x_0)} \pi_1(U_2; x_0) .\end{align*}
\item[Theorem (Van Kampen)]
If \(X = U \cup V\) where \(U, V, U\cap V\) are all path-connected then

\begin{align*} \pi_1(X) = \pi_1 U \ast_{\pi_1(U \cap V)} \pi_1 V ,\end{align*}

where the amalgamated product can be computed as follows: If we have
presentations

\begin{align*}  \pi_{1}(U, w) &= \left\langle u_{1}, \cdots, u_{k} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{l}\right\rangle \\  \pi_{1}(V, w) &=\left\langle v_{1}, \cdots, v_{m} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}\right\rangle \\  \pi_{1}(U \cap V, w) &=\left\langle w_{1}, \cdots, w_{p} {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\gamma_{1}, \cdots, \gamma_{q}\right\rangle  \end{align*}

then

\begin{align*} \pi_{1}(X, w)  &= \left\langle u_{1}, \cdots, u_{k}, v_{1}, \cdots, v_{m}\right\rangle \\  &\pmod \left\langle \alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{l}, \beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}, I\left(w_{1}\right) J\left(w_{1}\right)^{-1}, \cdots, I\left(w_{p}\right) J\left(w_{p}\right)^{-1}\right\rangle \\ &= \frac{\pi_1(U) \ast \pi_1(B)} {\left\langle{\left\{{I(w_i) J(w_i)^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}1\leq i \leq p}\right\}}\right\rangle} \end{align*}

where

\begin{align*} I: \pi_{1}(U \cap V, w) &\rightarrow \pi_{1}(U, w) \\ J: \pi_{1}(U \cap V, w) &\rightarrow \pi_{1}(V, w) .\end{align*}
\item[Theorem (Seifert-van Kampen Theorem)]
Suppose \(X = U_1 \cup U_2\) where
\(U \coloneqq U_1 \cap U_2 \neq \emptyset\) is path-connected, and let
\({\{\operatorname{pt}\}}\in U\). Then the maps \(i_1: U_1 \to X\) and
\(i_2: U_2 \to X\) induce the following group homomorphisms:

\begin{align*}
i_1^*: \pi_1(U_1 ,{\{\operatorname{pt}\}}) \to\pi_1(X, {\{\operatorname{pt}\}}) \\
i_2^*: \pi_1(U_2 ,{\{\operatorname{pt}\}}) \to\pi_1(X, {\{\operatorname{pt}\}})
\end{align*}

and letting \(P = \pi_1(U), {\{\operatorname{pt}\}}\), there is a
natural isomorphism

\begin{align*}
\pi_1(X, {\{\operatorname{pt}\}}) \cong \pi_1(U_1, {\{\operatorname{pt}\}}) ~\ast_P~ \pi_1(U_2, {\{\operatorname{pt}\}})
\end{align*}
where \(\ast_P\) is the amalgamated free product over \(P\).

Note that the hypothesis that \(U\cap V\) is path-connected is
necessary: take \(S^1\) with \(U,V\) neighborhoods of the poles, whose
intersection is two disjoint components.

\tightlist
\item[Example (of pushing out with Van Kampen)]
\(A = {\mathbb{Z}}/4{\mathbb{Z}}= \left\langle{x {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}x^4}\right\rangle, B = {\mathbb{Z}}/6{\mathbb{Z}}= \left\langle{y {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}x^6}\right\rangle, Z = {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}}= \left\langle{z {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}z^2}\right\rangle\).
\end{description}

Then we can identify \(Z\) as a subgroup of \(A, B\) using
\(\iota_A(z) = x^2\) and \(\iota_B(z) = y^3\).

So
\begin{align*}A\ast_Z B = \left\langle{x, y {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}x^4, y^6, x^2y^{-3}}\right\rangle\end{align*}

  General mantra: homotopy plays nicely with products, homology with
  wedge products.\footnote{More generally, in \(\mathbf{Top}\), we can
    look at \(A \leftarrow{\{\operatorname{pt}\}}\to B\) -- then
    \(A\times B\) is the pullback and \(A \vee B\) is the pushout. In
    this case, homology \(h: \mathbf{Top} \to \mathbf{Grp}\) takes
    pushouts to pullbacks but doesn't behave well with pullbacks.
    Similarly, while \(\pi\) takes pullbacks to pullbacks, it doesn't
    behave nicely with pushouts.}
\item
  \(\pi_k\prod X = \prod \pi_k X\) by LES.\footnote{This follows because
    \(X\times Y \twoheadrightarrow X\) is a fiber bundle, so use LES in
    homotopy and the fact that \(\pi_{i\geq 2} \in \mathbf{Ab}\).}
\end{itemize}

In general, homotopy groups behave nicely under homotopy pull-backs
(e.g., fibrations and products), but not homotopy push-outs (e.g.,
cofibrations and wedges). Homology is the opposite.

\hypertarget{definition-homotopy}{%
\subsection{Definition: Homotopy}\label{definition-homotopy}}

Let \(X, Y\) be topological spaces and \(f,g: X \to Y\) continuous maps.
Then a \emph{homotopy} from \(f\) to \(g\) is a continuous function

\(F: X \times I \to Y\)

such that

\(F(x, 0) = f(x)\) and \(F(x,1) = g(x)\)

for all \(x\in X\). If such a homotopy exists, we write \(f\simeq g\).
This is an equivalence relation on \(\text{Hom}(X,Y)\), and the set of
such classes is denoted \([X,Y] \coloneqq\hom (X,Y)/\simeq\).

\hypertarget{definition-nullhomotopic}{%
\subsection{Definition: Nullhomotopic}\label{definition-nullhomotopic}}

If \(f\) is homotopic to a constant map, say \(f: x \mapsto y_0\) for
some fixed \(y_0 \in Y\), then \(f\) is said to be \emph{nullhomotopic}.
In other words, if \(f:X\to Y\) is nullhomotopic, then there exists a
homotopy \(H: X\times I \to Y\) such that \(H(x, 0) = f(x)\) and
\(H(x, 1) = y_0\).

Note that constant maps (or anything homotopic) induce zero
homomorphisms.

\section{Theorem: Any two continuous functions into a convex set are
homotopic.}\label{theorem-any-two-continuous-functions-into-a-convex-set-are-homotopic.}}

Proof: The linear homotopy. Supposing \(X\) is convex, for any two
points \(x,y\in X\), the line \(tx + (1-t)y\) is contained in \(X\) for
every \(t\in[0,1]\). So let \(f, g: Z \to X\) be any continuous
functions into \(X\). Then define \(H: Z \times I \to X\) by
\(H(z,t) = tf(z) + (1-t)g(z)\), the linear homotopy between \(f,g\). By
convexity, the image is contained in \(X\) for every \(t,z\), so this is
a homotopy between \(f,g\).

\hypertarget{definition-homotopy-equivalence}{%
\subsection{Definition: Homotopy
Equivalence}\label{definition-homotopy-equivalence}}

Let \(f: X \to Y\) be a continuous map, then \(f\) is said to be a
\emph{homotopy equivalence} if there exists a continuous map
\(g: X \to Y\) such that

\(f\circ g \simeq\operatorname{id}_Y\) and
\(g\circ f \simeq\operatorname{id}_X\).

Such a map \(g\) is called a homotopy inverse of \(f\), the pair of maps
is a homotopy equivalence.

If such an \(f\) exists, we write \(X \simeq Y\) and say \(X\) and \(Y\)
have the same homotopy type, or that they are homotopy equivalent.

\begin{quote}
Note that homotopy equivalence is strictly weaker than homeomorphic
equivalence, i.e., \(X\cong Y\) implies \(X \simeq Y\) but not
necessarily the converse.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{definition-contractible}{%
\subsection{Definition: Contractible}\label{definition-contractible}}

A topological space \(X\) is \emph{contractible} if \(X\) is homotopy
equivalent to a point, i.e.~\(X \simeq\left\{{x_0}\right\}\). This means
that there exists a pair of homotopy inverses
\(f: X \to\left\{{x_0}\right\}\) and \(g:\left\{{x_0}\right\} \to X\)
such that \(f\circ g = \operatorname{id}_{\left\{{x_0}\right\}}\) and
\(g\circ f = \operatorname{id}_X\).

This is a useful property, because it supplies you with a homotopy.

\hypertarget{definition-deformation-retract}{%
\section{Definition: Deformation
Retract}\label{definition-deformation-retract}}

Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(A \subset X\) be a subspace, then
a \emph{retraction} of \(X\) onto \(A\) is a map \(r: X\to X\) such that
the image of \(X\) is \(A\) and \(r\) restricted to \(A\) is the
identity map on \(A\).

Note that this definition isn't very useful, as every space has at least
one retraction - for example, the constant map
\(r:X \to\left\{{x_0}\right\}\) for any \(x\_0 \in X\).

A \emph{deformation retract} is a homotopy \(H:X\times I \to X\) from
the identity on \(X\) to the identity on \(A\) that fixes \(A\) at all
times. That is,
\begin{align*}
H: X\times I \to X \\
H(x, 0) = \operatorname{id}_X \\
H(x, 1) = \operatorname{id}_A \\
x\in A \implies H(x, t) \in A \quad \forall t
\end{align*}

Equivalently, this requires that
\({\left.{{H}} \right|_{{A}} } = \operatorname{id}_A\)

A deformation retract between a space and a subspace is a homotopy
equivalence, and further \(X\simeq Y\) iff there is a \(Z\) such that
both \(X\) and \(Y\) are deformation retracts of \(Z\). Moreover, if
\(A\) and \(B\) both have deformation retracts onto a common space
\(X\), then \(A \simeq B\).

By definition, \(X\) is simply connected iff \(X\) is path connected and
every loop contracts to a point.

\(\Rightarrow\): Suppose \(X\) is simply connected. Then every loop in
\(X\) contracts to a point, so if \(\alpha\) is a loop in \(X\),
\([\alpha] = [\operatorname{id}_{x_0}]\), the identity element of
\(\pi_1(X)\). But then there is only one element in in this group.

\(\Leftarrow\): Suppose \(\pi_1(X) = 0\). Then there is just one element
in the fundamental group, the identity element, so if \(\alpha\) is a
loop in \(X\) then \([\alpha] = [\operatorname{id}_{x_0}]\). So there is
a homotopy taking \(\alpha\) to the constant map, which is a contraction
of \(\alpha\) to a point.

\hypertarget{definition-covering-maps}{%
\subsection{Definition: Covering Maps}\label{definition-covering-maps}}

A covering map of a space is a map \(p: \tilde X \to X\) such that each
open set \(U\in X\) pulls back to a disjoint union of open sets (called
sheets) in \(\tilde X\) (referred to as the covering space). That is,
\(p^{-1}(U) = \coprod_i V_i \subseteq \tilde X\).

If \(\tilde X\)is simply connected, it is the universal covering space -
that is, for any other covering space \(Y\) of \(X\), \(\tilde X\) is
also a cover of \(Y\). We also have
\(\text{Aut}(\tilde X) \cong \pi_1(X)\) for universal covers - for other
covers, \(\text{Aut}(\tilde X) \cong N(\Gamma) / \Gamma\) where
\(N(\cdot)\) is the normalizer and \(\Gamma\) is the set of homotopy
classes of loops in \(\tilde X\) that are lifted from loops in \(X\).

Covering spaces of \(X\) are in (contravariant) galois correspondence
with subgroups of \(\pi_1(X)\), i.e.~the covering map induces an
injective map on fundamental groups.

The number of sheets of a covering space is equal to
\([p^*(\pi_1(\tilde X)): \pi_1(X)]\).

\hypertarget{example-covering-spaces}{%
\subsubsection{Example: Covering spaces}\label{example-covering-spaces}}

Identify \(S^1 \subset {\mathbb{C}}\), then every map
\(p_n: S^1 \to S^1\) given by \(z\mapsto z^n\) a yields a covering space
\(\tilde X_n\). Note the induced map \(p_n^*: \pi_1(S^1) \to\pi_1(S^1)\)
is given by \([\omega_1] \mapsto [\omega_n] = n[\omega_1]\) and so
\(p_n^*(\pi_1(S^1)) = {\mathbb{Z}}_n = \text{Aut}(\tilde X_n)\). (This
can also be seen the other way, by looking at deck transformations which
are rotations of the circle by \(2\pi/n\))

The universal cover of \(S^1\) is \({\mathbb{R}}\); this is an
infinitely sheeted cover. The fiber above \(x_0\) is equal to
\({\mathbb{Z}}\). \(A:=B\)

The universal cover of \({\mathbb{RP}}^n\) is \(S^n\); this is a
two-sheeted cover. The fiber above \(x_0\) contains the two antipodal
points.

The universal cover of \(T = S^1 \times S^1\) is
\(\tilde X ={\mathbb{R}}\times{\mathbb{R}}\). The fiber above the base
point contains every point on the integer lattice
\({\mathbb{Z}}\times{\mathbb{Z}}= \pi_1(T) = \text{Aut}(\tilde X)\)

\hypertarget{theorem-homotopy-lifting}{%
\subsection{Theorem: Homotopy Lifting}\label{theorem-homotopy-lifting}}

The setup: given \(p: \tilde X \twoheadrightarrow X\) a covering space
of \(X\), a map \(f: Y \to X\), and a homotopy \(H: Y\times I \to X\)
such that \(f_0 \coloneqq H(y, 0)\) has a lift
\(\tilde f_0: Y\to\tilde X\).

Then there is a unique homotopy \(\tilde H: Y \times I \to\tilde X\)
satisfying \(p\circ \tilde H = H\) In other words, if the \(t=0\)
portion of a homotopy can be lifted to a cover, the entire homotopy can.

\hypertarget{theorem-lifting-criterion}{%
\subsection{Theorem: Lifting
Criterion}\label{theorem-lifting-criterion}}

Let \(p:\tilde X \twoheadrightarrow X\) be a covering of \(X\), and let
\(f:Y \to X\) be a map. Then there is an induced homomorphism
\(f^*: \pi_1(Y) \to\pi_1(X)\). There is also an induced map
\(p^*: \pi_1(\tilde X) \to\pi_1(X)\). We then have the following
condition:

There exists a lift \(\tilde f: Y \to\tilde X\) satisfying
\(p\circ\tilde f = f\) iff
\(f^*(\pi_1(Y)) \subseteq p^*(\pi_1(\tilde X))\), i.e.~when the
fundamental group of \(Y\) injects into the projected fundamental group
of the cover.

Note that if \(Y\) is simply connected, then \(\pi_1(Y) = 0\) and this
holds automatically!

Moreover, lifts are \emph{unique} if they agree at a single point.

(Technically you need the base space to be connected and ``locally
pathwise connected'')

\hypertarget{theorem-fundamental-theorem-of-covering-spaces}{%
\subsection{Theorem: Fundamental theorem of covering
spaces}\label{theorem-fundamental-theorem-of-covering-spaces}}

For every subgroup \(G \leq \pi_1(X)\), there is a corresponding
covering space \(X_G \twoheadrightarrow X\) such that
\(\pi_1(X_G) = G\). The universal cover is obtained by taking \(G\) to
be the trivial group.

Alternative phrasing: there is a contravariant, inclusion-reversing map
from subgroups of \(\pi_1(X)\) to covering spaces of \(X\).

If \(Y\) is contractible, then \(Y\) has the homotopy type of a point.
So there is a homotopy \(H: Y\times I \to Y\) between
\(\operatorname{id}_Y\) and a constant map \(c: y \mapsto y_0\). So
construct \(H': X\times I \to Y\) as \(H'(x, t) = H(f(x), t)\); then
\(H'(x, 0) = H(f(x), 0) = (\operatorname{id}_x \circ f)(x) = f(x)\) and
\(H'(x, 1) = H(f(x), 1) = (c \circ f)(x) = c(y) = y_0\) for some \(y\).
So \(H'\) is a homotopy between \(f\) and a constant map, and \(f\) is
nullhomotopic.

\subsection{Theorem: Any map that factors through a contractible space
is
nullhomotopic.}\label{theorem-any-map-that-factors-through-a-contractible-space-is-nullhomotopic.}}

Suppose we have the following commutative diagram:

Then \(f = p \circ \tilde f\). Every map into a contractible space is
nullhomotopic, so if \(Z\) is contractible, then there is a homotopy
\(\tilde H: X\times I \to Z\) from \(\tilde f\) to a constant map \(c\).
But then \(p\circ \tilde H: X \times I \to Y\) is also a homotopy from
\(f\) to the constant map \(p\circ c\).

This can be done by lifting \(f\) to \(\tilde f: X \to\tilde Y\), the
universal cover. If the covering space happens to be contractible, you
get that \(\tilde f\) is nullhomotopic. So there is a homotopy
\(\tilde H: X\times I \to\tilde Y\) - but then
\(p\circ\tilde H: X \to Y\) descends to a homotopy of \(f\). If you
leave \(f\) arbitrary, this would force \(\pi_1(Y) = 0\).

above \(x\). Then \(\alpha\) acts on \(\tilde x\) from the right, by the
rule \(\tilde x \curvearrowleft \alpha = \tilde\alpha(1)\).

Then
\(\text{stab}(\tilde x) = p_*(\pi_1(\tilde X, \tilde x)) \subseteq \pi_1(X, x)\),
and this induces a homomorphism \(\pi_1(X, x) \to\text{Aut}(p^{-1}(x))\)

For a wedge product \(X = \bigvee_i^n \tilde X_i\), the covering space

vertex with one of \(i\) colors denoting which space it covers. The
neighborhood of each colored vertex has edges corresponding to
\(\pi_1(X_i)\).

\begin{quote}
If X and Y are two reasonable spaces with universal covers \(\tilde X\)
and \(\tilde Y\), there is a nice picture of the universal cover
\(\widetilde{X\vee Y}\) which has the combinatorial pattern of an
infinite tree. The tree is bipartite with vertices labeled by the
symbols \(X\) and \(Y\). The edges from an \(X\) vertex are bijective
correspondence with the fundamental group \(\pi_1(X)\), and likewise for
\(Y\) vertices and \(\pi_1(Y)\). To make \(\widetilde{X\vee Y}\),
replace each \(X\) vertex by \(\tilde X\) and each \(Y\) vertex by
\(\tilde Y\). The base point of \(X\) lifts to
\({\left\lvert {\pi_1(X)} \right\rvert}\) points in \(\tilde X\), and

\subsection{Mayer-Vietoris}\label{mayer-vietoris}}

\begin{description}
\item[Theorem (Mayer Vietoris)]
Let \(X = A^\circ \cup B^\circ\); then there is a SES of chain complexes
\begin{align*} 0 \to C_n(A\cap B) \xrightarrow{x\mapsto (x, -x)} C_n(A) \oplus C_n(B) \xrightarrow{(x, y) \mapsto x+y} C_n(A + B) \to 0 \end{align*}

where \(C_n(A+B)\) denotes the chains that are sums of chains in \(A\)
and chains in \(B\). This yields a LES in homology:

\begin{align*} \cdots \to H_n(A\cap B) \xrightarrow{x\mapsto (x, -x)} H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B) \xrightarrow{(x, y) \mapsto x+y} H_n(X) \to \cdots .\end{align*}
\end{description}

Given \(A,B \subset X\) such that \(A^\circ \cup B^\circ = X\), there is
a long exact sequence in homology:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
 &  &  &  & \cdots \arrow[lllldd, out=0, in=-180, "\delta_3"'] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
H_2(A\cap B) \arrow[rr] \arrow[rr, "{(i^*, -j^*)_2}"] &  & H_2 A \oplus H_2 B \arrow[rr, "(l^* - r^*)_2"] &  & H_2 (A\cup B) \arrow[lllldd, "\delta_2"', out=0, in=-180] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
H_1(A\cap B) \arrow[rr, "{(i^*, -j^*)_1}"] &  & H_1 A \oplus H_1 B \arrow[rr, "(l^*-r^*)_1"] &  & H_1 (A\cup B) \arrow[lllldd, "\delta_1"', out=0, in=-180] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
H_0 (A\cap B) \arrow[rr, "{(i^*, -j^*)_0}"] &  & H_0 A \oplus H_0 B \arrow[rr, "(l^* - r^*)_0"] &  & H_0 (A\cup B) \arrow[lllldd, "\delta_0"', out=0, in=-180] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
0 &  &  &  &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

This is sometimes written in the following compact form:
\begin{align*} \cdots  H_n(A \cap B) \xrightarrow{(i^*,~ j^*)} H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B) \xrightarrow{l^* - r^*}  H_n(X) \xrightarrow{\delta} H_{n-1}(A\cap B)\cdots\end{align*}

Where

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(i: A\cap B \hookrightarrow A\) induces
  \(i^*: H_*(A\cap B) \to H_*(A)\)
\item
  \(j: A\cap B \hookrightarrow B\) induces
  \(j^*: H_*(A\cap B) \to H_*(B)\)
\item
  \(l: A \hookrightarrow A\cup B\) induces \(l^*: H_*(A) \to H_*(X)\)
\item
  \(r: B \hookrightarrow A\cup B\) induces \(r^*: H_*(B) \to H_*(X)\)
\end{itemize}

The connecting homomorphisms \(\delta_n :H_n(X) \to H_{n-1}(X)\) are
defined by taking a class \([\alpha] \in H_n(X)\), writing it as an
\(n\)-cycle \(z\), then decomposing \(z = \sum c_i\) where each \(c_i\)
is an \(x+y\) chain. Then \({\partial}(c_i) = {\partial}(x+y) = 0\),
since the boundary of a cycle is zero, so
\({\partial}(x) = -{\partial}(y)\). So then just define
\(\delta([\alpha]) = [{\partial}x] = [-{\partial}y]\).

\begin{proposition}[?]

\begin{align*}H^i(S^n) \cong H^{i-1}(S^{n-1}).\end{align*}

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

Write \(X = A \cup B\), the northern and southern hemispheres, so that
\(A \cap B = S^{n-1}\), the equator. In the LES, we have:

\begin{align*} H^{i+1}(S^n) \xrightarrow{} H^i(S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{} H^iA \oplus H^i B \xrightarrow{} H^i S^n \xrightarrow{} H^{i-1}(S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{} H^{i-1}A \oplus H^{i-1}B .\end{align*}

But \(A, B\) are contractible, so \(H^iA= H^iB = 0\), so we have

\begin{align*} H^{i+1}(S^n) \xrightarrow{} H^{i}(S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{} 0 \oplus 0 \xrightarrow{}H^i(S^n) \xrightarrow{} H^{i-1}(S^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{} 0 .\end{align*}

In particular, we have the shape \(0 \to A \to B \to 0\) in an exact
sequence, which is always an isomorphism.

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Eilenber-Zilber]

Given two spaces \(X, Y\), there are chain maps

\begin{align*} F: C_*(X\times Y; R)              &\to C_*(X; R) \otimes_R C_*(Y; R) \\ G: C_*(X; R) \otimes_R C_*(Y; R)  &\to C_*(X\times Y; R)  \end{align*}

such that \(FG = \operatorname{id}\) and \(GF \simeq\operatorname{id}\).
In particular,
\begin{align*} H_*(X\times Y; R) &\cong H_*(X; R) \otimes_R H_*(Y; R) .\end{align*}

There exists a short exact sequence
\begin{align*}
0 \to \bigoplus_{i+j=k} H_j(X; R) \otimes_R H_{i}(Y; R) \to H_k(X\times Y; R) \to \bigoplus_{i+j=k-1} \operatorname{Tor}_R^1(H_i(X; R), H_{j}(Y; R))
\end{align*}
It has a non-canonical splitting given by
\begin{align*}
H_k (X\times Y) = \left( \bigoplus_{i+j = k} H_i X \oplus H_j Y\right) \oplus \bigoplus_{i+j = k-1}\operatorname{Tor}(H_iX, H_j Y)
\end{align*}

\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[UCT for Change of Group]

For changing coefficients from \({\mathbb{Z}}\) to \(G\) an arbitrary
group, there are short exact sequences
\begin{align*}
0 \to H_i X \otimes G \to H_i(X; G) \to \operatorname{Tor}(H_{i-1}X, G) \to 0
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
0 \to \operatorname{Ext}(H_{i-1} X, G) \to H^i(X;G) \to \hom(H_i X, G) \to 0
\end{align*}

which split unnaturally:
\begin{align*}
H_i(X;G) = (H_iX\otimes G) \oplus \operatorname{Tor}(H_{i-1}X; G)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
H^i(X; G) = \hom(H_iX, G) \oplus \operatorname{Ext}(H_{i-1}X; G)
\end{align*}

When \(H_iX\) are all finitely generated, write
\(H_i(X; {\mathbb{Z}}) = {\mathbb{Z}}^{\beta_i} \oplus T_i\). Then
\begin{align*}
H^i(X; {\mathbb{Z}}) = {\mathbb{Z}}^{\beta_i} \oplus T_{i-1}.

My personal crutch is to just think about complements in \(S^3\), which

\(K(\pi, 1)\)s. Now if \(K\) is a knot and \(X\) is its complement in

Apply Mayer-Vietoris, taking \(S^3 = n(K) \cup (S^3-K)\), where

Let \(X = {\mathbb{R}}^3 - \Delta^{(1)}\), the complement of the
skeleton of regular tetrahedron, and compute \(\pi_1(X)\) and
\(H_*(X)\).

Lay the graph out flat in the plane, then take a maximal tree - these
leaves 3 edges, and so \(\pi_1(X) = {\mathbb{Z}}^{\ast 3}\).

Moreover \(X \simeq S^1\vee S^1 \vee S^1\) which has only a 1-skeleton,
thus \(H_*(X) = [{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}^3, 0\rightarrow]\).

Let \(X = S^1 \times B^2 - L\) where \(L\) is two linked solid torii

\hypertarget{section-2}{%
\subsection{3}\label{section-2}}

Let \(L\) be a 3-manifold with homology
\([{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}_3, 0, {\mathbb{Z}}, \ldots]\) and let
\(X = L \times\Sigma L\). Compute \(H_*(X), H^*(X)\).

Useful facts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(H_{k}(X\times Y) \cong \bigoplus _{{i+j=k}}H_{i}(X)\otimes H_{j}(Y) \bigoplus_{i+j=k-1}\operatorname{Tor}(H_i(X), H_j(Y))\)
\item
  \(\tilde H_i(\Sigma X) = \tilde H_{i-1}(X)\)
\end{itemize}

We will use the fact that
\(H_*(\Sigma L) = [{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}_3, 0, {\mathbb{Z}}]\).

Represent \(H_*(L)\) by \(p(x, y) = 1 + yx + x^3\) and \(H_*(\Sigma L)\)
by \(q(x,y) = 1 + x + yx^2 + x^4\), we can extract the free part of
\(H_*(X)\) by multiplying

\begin{align*}p(x,y)q(x,y) = 1 + (1+y)x + 2yx^2 + (y^2+1)x^3 + 2x^4 + 2yx^5 + x^7\end{align*}

where multiplication corresponds to the tensor product, addition to the
direct sum/product.

So the free portion is
\begin{align*}H_*(X) = [{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}\oplus {\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}_3\otimes{\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}\oplus {\mathbb{Z}}_3\otimes{\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}^2, {\mathbb{Z}}_3^2, 0, {\mathbb{Z}}] \\
=[{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}\oplus {\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}\oplus {\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}^2, {\mathbb{Z}}_3^2, 0, {\mathbb{Z}}]
\end{align*}

We can add in the correction from torsion by noting that only terms of
the form
\(\operatorname{Tor}({\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}_3) = {\mathbb{Z}}_3\)
survive. These come from the terms \(i=1, j=2\), so
\(i+j=k-1 \implies k = 1+2+1 = 4\) and there is thus an additional
torsion term appearing in dimension 4. So we have

\begin{align*}H_*(X) = [{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}\times {\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}\times {\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}^2 \times {\mathbb{Z}}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}_3^2, 0, {\mathbb{Z}}] \\ = [{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}, 0,{\mathbb{Z}},{\mathbb{Z}}^2,0,0,{\mathbb{Z}}] \times [0,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3^2,0,0]\end{align*}

and
\begin{align*}H^*(X)= [{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}, 0,{\mathbb{Z}},{\mathbb{Z}}^2,0,0,{\mathbb{Z}}] \times [0, 0,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3^2,0] \\ = [{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}\times {\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}^2\times {\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3,{\mathbb{Z}}_3^2,{\mathbb{Z}}].\end{align*}

Let \(M\) be a closed, connected, oriented 4-manifold such that
\(H_2(M; {\mathbb{Z}})\) has rank 1. Show that there is not a free
\({\mathbb{Z}}_2\) action on \(M\).

Useful facts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(X \twoheadrightarrow_{\times p} Y\) induces \(\chi(X) = p\chi(Y)\)
\item
  Moral: always try a simple Euler characteristic argument first!
\end{itemize}

We know that
\(H_*(M) = [{\mathbb{Z}}, A, {\mathbb{Z}}\times G, A, {\mathbb{Z}}]\)
for some group \(A\) and some torsion group \(G\). Letting
\(n=\mathrm{rank}(A)\) and taking the Euler characteristic, we have
\(\chi(M) = (1)1 + (-1)n + (1)1 + (-1)n + (1)1 = 3-2n\). Note that this
is odd for any \(n\).

However, a free action of \({\mathbb{Z}}_2 \curvearrowright M\) would
produce a double covering
\(M \twoheadrightarrow_{\times 2} M/{\mathbb{Z}}_2\), and
multiplicativity of Euler characteristics would force
\(\chi(M) = 2 \chi(M/{\mathbb{Z}}_2)\) and thus \(3-2n = 2k\) for some
integer \(k\). This would require \(3-2n\) to be even, so we have a
contradiction. \(\hfill\blacksquare\)

Let \(X\) be \(T^2\) with a 2-cell attached to the interior along a
longitude. Compute \(\pi_2(X)\).

Useful facts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(T^2 = e^0 + e^1_1 + e^1_2 + e^2\) as a CW complex.
\item
  \(S^2/(x_0 \sim x_1) \simeq S^2 \wedge S^1\) when \(x_0, x_1\) are two
  distinct points. (Picture: sphere with a string handle connecting
  north/south poles.)
\item
  \(\pi_{\geq 2}(\tilde X) \cong \pi_{\geq 2}(X)\) for
  \(\tilde X \twoheadrightarrow X\) the universal cover.
\end{itemize}

Write \(T^2 = e^0 + e^1_1 + e^1_2 + e^2\), where the first and second
1-cells denote the longitude and meridian respectively. By symmetry, we
could have equivalently attached a disk to the meridian instead of the
longitude, filling the center hole in the torus. Contract this disk to a
point, then pull it vertically in both directions to obtain \(S^2\) with
two points identified, which is homotopy-equivalent to \(S^2 \vee S_1\).

Take the universal cover, which is
\({\mathbb{R}}^1 \cup_{{\mathbb{Z}}} S^2\) and has the same \(\pi_2\).
This is homotopy-equivalent to \(\bigvee_{i\in {\mathbb{Z}}}S^2\) and so
\(\pi_2(X) = \prod_{i\in {\mathbb{Z}}} {\mathbb{Z}}\) generated by each
distinct copy of \(S^2\). (Alternatively written as
\({\mathbb{Z}}[t, t^{-1}]\)).

Show that \({\mathbb{Z}}^{\ast 2}\) has subgroups isomorphic to

Facts Used 1. \(\pi_1(\bigvee^k S^1) = {\mathbb{Z}}^{\ast k}\) 2.
\(\tilde X \twoheadrightarrow X \implies \pi_1(\tilde X) \hookrightarrow\pi_1(X)\)
3. Every subgroup \(G \leq \pi_1(X)\) corresponds to a covering space
\(X_G \twoheadrightarrow X\) 4.
\(A \subseteq B \implies F(A) \leq F(B)\) for free groups.

It is easier to prove the stronger claim that
\({\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathbb{N}}\leq {\mathbb{Z}}^{\ast 2}\) (i.e.~the free
group on countably many generators) and use fact 4 above.

Just take the covering space
\(\tilde X \twoheadrightarrow S^1 \vee S^1\) defined via the gluing map
\({\mathbb{R}}\cup_{{\mathbb{Z}}} S^1\) which attaches a circle to each
integer point, taking 0 as the base point. Then let \(a\) denote a
translation and \(b\) denote traversing a circle, so we have
\(\pi_1(\tilde X) = \left<\cup_{n\in{\mathbb{Z}}}a^nba^{-n}\right>\)
which is a free group on countably many generators. Since \(\tilde X\)
is a covering space,
\(\pi_1(\tilde X) \hookrightarrow\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) = {\mathbb{Z}}^{\ast 2}\).
By 4, we can restrict this to \(n\) generators for any \(n\) to get a
subgroup, and \(A\leq B \leq C \implies A \leq C\) as groups.

Let \(N\) be the knotted solid torus, so that \({\partial}N = T^2\), and

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(S^3 = N \cup_{T^2} X\)
\item
  \(N \cap X = T^2\)
\end{itemize}

and we apply Mayer-Vietoris to \(S^3\):

\begin{align*} 4\qquad H_4(T^2) \to H_4(N) \times H_4(X) \to H_4(S^3) \\ 3\qquad H_3(T^2) \to H_3(N) \times H_3(X) \to H_3(S^3) \\ 2\qquad H_2(T^2) \to H_2(N) \times H_2(X) \to H_2(S^3) \\ 1\qquad H_1(T^2) \to H_1(N) \times H_1(X) \to H_1(S^3) \\ 0\qquad H_0(T^2) \to H_0(N) \times H_0(X) \to H_0(S^3) \\ .\end{align*}

where we can plug in known information and deduce some maps:

\begin{align} 4\qquad &0 \to &0 \qquad\to &0 \xrightarrow{{\partial}_4} \\ 3\qquad &0 \to &H_3(X) \qquad\to &{\mathbb{Z}}\xrightarrow{{\partial}_3}\\ 2\qquad &{\mathbb{Z}}\to &H_2(X) \qquad\to &0 \xrightarrow{{\partial}_2}\\ 1\qquad &{\mathbb{Z}}^2 \cong &{\mathbb{Z}}\times H_1(X) \qquad\to &0 \xrightarrow{{\partial}_1}\\ 0\qquad &{\mathbb{Z}}\to &{\mathbb{Z}}\times H_0(X) \qquad\to &{\mathbb{Z}}\to 0 \\ \end{align}

We then deduce: - \(H_0(X) = {\mathbb{Z}}\) by the splitting of the line
0 SES
\begin{align*}
  0 \to {\mathbb{Z}}\to {\mathbb{Z}}\times H_0(X) \to {\mathbb{Z}}\to 0
  \end{align*}
yielding \(Z\times H_0(X) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}\times {\mathbb{Z}}\). -
\(H_1(X) = {\mathbb{Z}}\) by the line 1 SES
\begin{align*}
  0 \to {\mathbb{Z}}^2 \to {\mathbb{Z}}\times H_1(X) \to 0
  \end{align*}
which yields an isomorphism. - \(H_2(X) = H_3(X) = 0\) by examining the
SES spanning lines 3 and 2:
\begin{align*}
  0 \hookrightarrow H_3(X) \hookrightarrow{\mathbb{Z}}\xrightarrow{\cong_{{\partial}_3}} {\mathbb{Z}}\twoheadrightarrow H_2(X) \twoheadrightarrow 0

Show there is no homeomorphism \({\mathbb{CP}}^2{\circlearrowleft}_f\)
such that \(f({\mathbb{CP}}^1)\) is disjoint from
\({\mathbb{CP}}_1 \subset {\mathbb{CP}}_2\).

Facts used:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Every homeomorphism induces isomorphisms on
  homotopy/homology/cohomology.
\item
  \(H^*({\mathbb{CP}}^2) = {\mathbb{Z}}[\alpha] / (\alpha^2)\) where
  \(\deg \alpha = 2\).
\item
  \([f(X)] = f_*([X])\)
\item
  \(a\dot{} b = 0 \implies a=0~\text{or}~b=0\) (nondegeneracy).
\end{enumerate}

Supposing such a homeomorphism exists, we would have
\([{\mathbb{CP}}^1] \dot{} [f({\mathbb{CP}}^1)] = 0\) by the definition
of these submanifolds being disjoint.

But
\([{\mathbb{CP}}^1]\dot{}[f({\mathbb{CP}}^1)] = [{\mathbb{CP}}^1]\dot{} f_*([{\mathbb{CP}}^1])\),
where
\begin{align*}
f_*: H^*({\mathbb{CP}}^2) \to H^*({\mathbb{CP}}^2)
\end{align*}
is the induced map on cohomology.

Since the intersection pairing is nondegenerate, either
\([{\mathbb{CP}}^1] = 0\) or \(f_*([{\mathbb{CP}}^1]) = 0\).

We know that \(H^*({\mathbb{CP}}^2) = {\mathbb{Z}}[\alpha] / \alpha^2\)
where \(\alpha = [{\mathbb{CP}}^1]\), however, so this forces
\(f_*([{\mathbb{CP}}^1]) = 0\). But since this was a generator of
\(H^*\), we have \(f_*(H^*({\mathbb{CP}}^2)) = 0\), so \(f\) is not an
isomorphism on cohomology. \(\hfill\blacksquare\)

Facts used: - Homotopy LES - Hurewicz - \(0\to A\to B \to 0\) exact iff
\(A\cong B\)

From the LES in homotopy we have

\begin{align} 4\qquad \pi_4(S^3) \to \pi_4(E) \to \pi_4(S^5) \\ 3\qquad \pi_3(S^3) \to \pi_3(E) \to \pi_3(S^5) \\ 2\qquad \pi_2(S^3) \to \pi_2(E) \to \pi_2(S^5) \\ 1\qquad \pi_1(S^3) \to \pi_1(E) \to \pi_1(S^5) \\ 0\qquad \pi_0(S^3) \to \pi_0(E) \to \pi_0(S^5) \\ \end{align}

and plugging in known information yields

\begin{align} 4\qquad &\pi_4(S^3) \to &\pi_4(E) \quad \to 0 \\ 3\qquad &{\mathbb{Z}}\to &\pi_3(E) \quad\to 0 \\ 2\qquad &0 \to &\pi_2(E) \quad\to 0 \\ 1\qquad &0 \to &\pi_1(E) \quad\to 0 \\ 0\qquad &{\mathbb{Z}}\to &\pi_0(E) \quad\to {\mathbb{Z}}\\ \end{align}

where rows 3 and 4 force \(\pi_3(E) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}\), rows 0 and 1
force \(\pi_0(E) = {\mathbb{Z}}\), and the remaining rows force
\(\pi_1(E) = \pi_2(E) = 0\).

By Hurewicz, we thus have \(H_3(E) = \pi_3(E) = {\mathbb{Z}}\).

Let \(X\) be the subspace of the unit cube \(I^3\) consisting of the
union of the 6 faces and the 4 internal diagonals. Compute \(\pi_1(X)\).

\textbf{Solution}:

\hypertarget{section-15}{%
\subsection{2}\label{section-15}}

Let \(X\) be an arbitrary topological space, and compute
\(\pi_1(\Sigma X)\).

\textbf{Solution}:

Write \(\Sigma X = U \cup V\) where \(U = \Sigma X - (X\times[0,1/2])\)
and \(U = \Sigma X - X\times[1/2, 1])\). Then
\(U\cap V = X \times\{1/2\} \cong X\), so \(\pi_1(U\cap V) =\pi_1(X)\).

But both \(U\) and \(V\) can be identified by the cone on \(X\), given
by \(CX = \frac{X \times I}{X \times 1}\), by just rescaling the
interval with the maps:

\(i_U: U \to CX\) where \((x,s) \mapsto (x, 2s-1)\) (The second
component just maps \([1/2, 1] \to[0,1]\). )

\(i_V: V \to CX\) where \((x, s) \mapsto (x, 2s)\). (The second
component just maps \([0,1/2] \to [0, 1]\))

But \(CX\) is contractible by the homotopy \(H:CX \times I \to CX\)
where \(H((c,s), t) = (c, s(1-t))\).

So \(\pi_1(U) = \pi_1(V) = 0\).

By Van Kampen, we have \(\pi_1(X) = 0 \ast_{\pi_1(X)} 0 = 0.\)

\hypertarget{section-16}{%
\subsection{3}\label{section-16}}

Let \(X = S^1 \times S^1\) and \(A\subset X\) be a subspace with
\(A \cong S^1 \vee S^1\). Show that there is no retraction from \(X\) to
\(A\).

\textbf{Solution}:

We have \(\pi_1(S^1 \times S^1) = \pi_1(S^1) \times\pi_1(S^1)\) since
\(S^1\) is path-connected (by a lemma from the problem sets), and this
equals \({\mathbb{Z}}\times{\mathbb{Z}}\).

We also have
\(\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) = \pi_1(S^1) \ast_{\left\{{pt}\right\}} \pi_1(S^1)\),
which by Van-Kampen is \({\mathbb{Z}}\ast {\mathbb{Z}}\).

Suppose \(X\) retracts onto \(A\), we can then look at the inclusion
\(\iota: A \hookrightarrow X\). The induced homomorphism
\(\iota_*: \pi_1(A) \hookrightarrow\pi_1(X)\) is then also injective, so
we've produced an injection from
\(f: {\mathbb{Z}}\ast {\mathbb{Z}}\hookrightarrow{\mathbb{Z}}\times{\mathbb{Z}}\).

This is a contradiction, because no such injection can exists. In
particular, the commutator \([a,b]\) is nontrivial in the source. But
\(f(aba^{-1}b^{-1}) = f(a)f(b)f(a)^{-1}f(b)^{-1}\) since \(f\) is a
homomorphism, but since the target is a commutative group, this has to
equal \(f(a)f(a)^{-1} f(b)f(b)^{-1} = e\). So there is a non-trivial
element in the kernel of \(f\), and \(f\) can not be injective - a
contradiction.

\hypertarget{section-17}{%
\subsection{4}\label{section-17}}

Show that for every map \(f: S^2 \to S^1\), there is a point
\(x\in S^2\) such that \(f(x) = f(-x)\).

\textbf{Solution}:

Suppose towards a contradiction that \(f\) does not possess this
property, so there is no \(x\in S^2\) such that \(f(x) = f(-x)\).

Then define \(g: S^2 \to S^1\) by \(g(x) = {f(x) - f(-x)}\); by
assumption, this is a nontrivial map, i.e.~\(g(x) \neq 0\) for
\emph{any} \(x\in S^2\).

In particular, \(-g(-x) = -{(f(-x) - f(x))} = {f(x) - f(-x)} = g(x)\),
so \(-g(x) = g(-x)\) and thus \(g\) commutes with the antipodal map
\(\alpha: S^2 \to S^2\).

This means \(g\) is constant on the fibers of the quotient map
\(p: S^2 \to{\mathbb{RP}}2\), and thus descends to a well defined map
\(\tilde g: {\mathbb{RP}}2 \to S^1\), and since
\(S^1 \cong {\mathbb{RP}}1\), we can identify this with a map
\(\tilde g: {\mathbb{RP}}2 \to{\mathbb{RP}}1\) which thus induces a
homomorphism
\(\tilde g_*: \pi_1({\mathbb{RP}}2) \to \pi_1({\mathbb{RP}}1)\).

Since \(g\) was nontrivial, \(\tilde g\) is nontrivial, and by
functoriality of \(\pi_1\), \(\tilde g_*\) is nontrivial.

But \(\pi_1({\mathbb{RP}}2) = {\mathbb{Z}}_2\) and
\(\pi_1({\mathbb{RP}}1) = {\mathbb{Z}}\), and
\(\tilde g_*: {\mathbb{Z}}^2 \to{\mathbb{Z}}\) can only be the trivial
homomorphism - a contradiction.

\(f_2 \circ f_1 = 0\).

Some useful results:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(0 \to A \hookrightarrow_{f} B\) is exact iff \(f\) is
  \textbf{injective}
\item
  \(B\twoheadrightarrow_{f} C \to 0\) is exact iff \(f\) is
  \textbf{surjective}
\item
  \(0\to A \to B \to 0\) is exact iff \(A \cong B\).
\item
  \(A \hookrightarrow B \to C \to D \twoheadrightarrow E\) iff \(C = 0\)
\item
  \(0\to A \to B \xrightarrow{\cong} C \to D\to 0\) iff \(A = D = 0\).

  \tightlist
  \item
    Todo: Proof
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(0\to A\to B \to C \to 0\) splits iff \(C\) is free.
\end{itemize}

Can think of \(C \cong \frac{B}{\operatorname{im}f_1}\).

The sequences \emph{splits} when a morphism \(f_2^{-1}: C \to B\)
exists. In \(\textbf{Ab}\), this means \(B \cong A \oplus C\), in

\begin{remark}

Is \(f_1\circ f_2 = 0\) equivalent to exactness..? Answer: yes, every
exact sequence is a chain complex with trivial homology. Therefore
homology measures the failure of exactness.

cycles.

0 \to T_p(A\cap B) \to T_p A \times T_p B \to T_p X \to 0
\end{align*}

which determines an orientation on \(A\cap B\).

Then the images under inclusion define homology classes

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \([A] \in H_{\widehat{i}}X\)
\item
  \([B] \in H_{\widehat{j}}X\)
\item
  \([A\cap B] \in H_{\widehat{i+j}}X\).
\end{itemize}

Denoting their Poincare duals by

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \([A]^\vee\in H^i X\)
\item
  \([B]^\vee\in H^j X\)
\item
  \([A\cap B]^\vee\in H^{i+j}X\)
\end{itemize}

We then have
\begin{align*}
[A]^\vee\smile [B]^\vee= [A\cap B]^\vee\in H^{i+j} X
\end{align*}

Example: in \({\mathbb{CP}}^n\), each even-dimensional cohomology
\(H^{2i}{\mathbb{CP}}^n\) has a generator \(\alpha_i\) with is Poincare
dual to an \(\widehat{i}\) plane. A generic \(\widehat{i}\) plane
intersects a \(\widehat{j}\) plane in a \(\widehat{i+j}\) plane,
yielding \(\alpha_i \smile \alpha_j = \alpha_{i+j}\) for \(i+j \leq n\).

Example: For \(T^2\), we have - \(H_1T^2 = {\mathbb{Z}}^2\) generated by
\([A], [B]\), the longitudinal and meridian circles. -
\(H_0T^2 = {\mathbb{Z}}\) generated by \([p]\), the class of a point.

Then \(A\cap B = \pm [p]\), and so
\begin{align*}
[A]^\vee\smile [B]^\vee= [p]^\vee\\
[B]^\vee\smile [A]^\vee= -[p]^\vee
\end{align*}
