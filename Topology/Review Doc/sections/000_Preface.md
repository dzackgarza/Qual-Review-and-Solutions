## Notation

- $A\cross B, \prod X_j$ are direct products.

- $A\oplus B, \bigoplus_j X_j$ are direct sums, the subset of $A\cross B$ where only finitely many terms are nonzero.
  - ${\ZZ}^n$ denotes the direct sum of $n$ copies of the group ${\ZZ}$.
  - Note that $A \oplus B \injects A\cross B$.

- $A\ast B, \ast_j X_J$ are free products, $F_n \da \ZZ^{\ast n}$ is the free group on $n$ generators.

  - Note that the abelianization yields $\qty{\ast_j X_j} = \bigoplus_j X_j$.
