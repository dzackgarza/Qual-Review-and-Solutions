## Notation

- $A\cross B, \prod X_i$ are direct products.

- $A\oplus B, \bigoplus_i X_i$ are direct sums, the subset of $A\cross B$ where only finitely many terms are nonzero.
  - $\Bbb{Z}^n$ denotes the direct sum of $n$ copies of the group $\Bbb{Z}$.
  - Note that $A \oplus B \injects A\cross B$.

- $A\ast B, \bigast X_i$ are free products, $F_n \da \ZZ^{\ast n}$ is the free group on $n$ generators.

  - Note that the abelianization yields $\qty{\bigast X_i}
