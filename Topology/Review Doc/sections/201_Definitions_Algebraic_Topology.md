# Definitions: Algebraic Topology


- Acyclic

- Alexander duality

- Basis
	* For an $R\dash$module $M$, a basis $B$ is a linearly independent generating set.

- Boundary

- Boundary of a manifold
	* Points $x\in M^n$ defined by 
	$$
	\del M = \theset{x\in M: H_n(M, M-\theset{x}; \ZZ) = 0}
	$$

- Cap Product
	* Denoting $\Delta^p \mapsvia{\sigma} X \in C_p(X; G)$, a map that sends pairs ($p\dash$chains, $q\dash$cochains) to $(p-q)\dash$chains $\Delta^{p-q} \to X$ by
	$$
	H_p(X; R)\cross H^q(X; R) \mapsvia{\frown} H_{p-q}(X; R)\\
	\sigma \frown \psi = \psi(F_0^q(\sigma))F_q^p(\sigma)
	$$
	where $F_i^j$ is the face operator, which acts on a simplicial map $\sigma$ by restriction to the face spanned by $[v_i \ldots v_j]$, i.e. $F_i^j(\sigma) =\restrictionof{\sigma}{[v_i \ldots v_j]}$.

- Cellular Homology

- CW Cell
	- An $n\dash$cell of $X$, say $e^n$, is the image of a map $\Phi: B^n \to X$. That is, $e^n = \Phi(B^n)$. Attaching an $n\dash$cell to $X$ is equivalent to forming the space $B^n \coprod_f X$ where $f: \del B^n \to X$.
		- A $0\dash$cell is a point.
		- A $1\dash$cell is an interval $[-1, 1] = B^1 \subset \RR^1$. Attaching requires a map from $S^0 =\theset{-1, +1} \to X$
		- A $2\dash$cell is a solid disk $B^2 \subset \RR^2$ in the plane. Attaching requires a map $S^1 \to X$.
		- A $3\dash$cell is a solid ball $B^3 \subset \RR^3$. Attaching requires a map from the sphere $S^2 \to X$.

- Cellular Map
	* A map $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ is said to be cellular if $f(X^{(n)}) \subseteq Y^{(n)}$ where $X^{(n)}$ denotes the $n\dash$ skeleton.

- Chain
	* An element $c \in C_p(X; R)$ can be represented as the singular $p$ simplex $\Delta^p \to X$.

- Chain Homotopy
	* Given two maps between chain complexes $(C_*, \del_C) \mapsvia{f, ~g} (D_*, \del_D)$, a chain homotopy is a family $h_i: C_i \to B_{i+1}$ satisfying $$f_i-g_i = \del_{B, i-1}\circ h_n + h_{i+1}\circ \del_{A, i}$$.

- Chain Map
	* A map between chain complexes $(C_*, \del_C) \mapsvia{f} (D_*, \del_D)$ is a chain map iff each component $C_i \mapsvia{f_i} D_i$ satisfies 
	$$
	f_{i-1}\circ\del_{C, i} = \del_{D,i} \circ f_i
	$$ 
	(i.e this forms a commuting ladder)

- Closed manifold
	* A manifold that is compact, with or without boundary.

- Coboundary

- Cochain
	* An cochain $c \in C^p(X; R)$ is a map $c \in \hom(C_p(X; R), R)$ on chains.

- Cocycle

:::{.definition title="Constant Map"}
A *constant map* $f: X\to Y$ iff $f(X) = y_0$ for some $y_0\in Y$, i.e. for every $x\in X$ the output value $f(x) = y_0$ is the same.
:::


- Colimit

- Compact
	* A space $X$ is compact iff every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.

- Cone
	* For a space $X$, defined as
	$$
	CX = \frac{X\cross I} {X \cross \theset{0}}
	$$
	Example: The cone on the circle $CS^1$ ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Cone.svg/250px-Cone.svg.png)
	Note that the cone embeds $X$ in a contractible space $CX$.

- Contractible
	* A space is contractible if its identity map is nullhomotopic.

- Contractible

- Coproduct

- Covering Space

- Cup Product
	- A map taking pairs ($p\dash$cocycles, $q\dash$cocycles) to $(p+q)\dash$cocyles by
	$$
	H^p(X; R) \cross H^q(X; R) \mapsvia{\smile} H^{p+q}(X; R)\\
	(a \cup b)(\sigma) = a(\sigma \circ I_0^p)~b(\sigma \circ I_p^{p+q})
	$$
	where $\Delta^{p+q} \mapsvia{\sigma} X$ is a singular $p+q$ simplex and
	$$
	I_i^j: [i, \cdots, j] \injects\Delta^{p+q}
	$$
	is an embedding of the $(j-i)\dash$simplex into a $(p+q)\dash$simplex.
	On a manifold, the cup product is Poincare dual to the intersection of submanifolds.

- CW Complex

- Cycle

- Deck Transformation

- Deformation

- Deformation Retract
	- A map $r$ in $A\mathrel{\textstyle\substack{\Large\injects^{\iota}\\\textstyle\dashleftarrow_{r}}} X$ that is a retraction (so $r\circ \iota = \id_A$) **that also satisfies** $\iota \circ r \homotopic \id_X$.
    
    > Note that this is equality in one direction, but only homotopy equivalence in the other.

  - Equivalently, a map $F:I\cross X\to X$ such that 
    - $F_0(x) = \id_X$
    - $F_t(x)\mid_A = \id_A$
    - $F_1(X) = A$

- Degree of a Map

- Direct Limit

- Euler Characteristic

- Exact Functor
	* A functor $T$ is *right exact* if a short exact sequence 
	$$0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$$ 
	yields an exact sequence 
	$$\ldots TA \to TB \to TC \to 0,$$ 
	and is *left exact* if it yields 
	$$0 \to TA \to TB \to TC \to \ldots$$
	Thus a functor is exact iff it is both left and right exact, yielding
	$$
	0 \to TA \to TB \to TC \to 0
	$$
	* Examples:
		* $\wait \tensor_R \wait$ is a right exact bifunctor.

	$$
	H_{\hat i}M \tensor H_{\hat j}M \to H_{\widehat{i+j}}X\\
	\alpha\tensor \beta \mapsto \left< \alpha, \beta \right>
	$$
	obtained by conjugating the cup product with Poincare Duality, i.e. $$\left< \alpha, \beta \right> = [M] \frown ([\alpha]\dual \smile [\beta]\dual)$$

	Then, if $[A], [B]$ are transversely intersecting submanifolds representing $\alpha, \beta$, then $$\left<\alpha, \beta\right> = [A\intersect B]$$.

	If $\hat i = j$ then $\left< \alpha, \beta \right> \in H_0 M = \ZZ$ is the signed number of intersection points.

- Inverse Limit

- Intersection Pairing
	- The pairing obtained from dualizing Poincare Duality to obtain $$\mathrm{F}(H_i M) \tensor \mathrm{F}(H_{n-i}M) \to \ZZ$$
	Computed as an oriented intersection number between two homology classes (perturbed to be transverse).

- Intersection Form
	- The nondegenerate bilinear form cohomology induced by the Kronecker Pairing: $$I: H^k(M_n) \cross H^{n-k}(M^n) \to \ZZ$$
	where $n=2k$.
      - When $k$ is odd, $I$ is skew-symmetric and thus a *symplectic form.*
      - When $k$ is even (and thus $n \equiv 0 \mod 4$) this is a symmetric form.
      - Satisfies $I(x,y) = (-1)^{k(n-k)} I(y, x)$

- Kronecker Pairing
	- A map pairing a chain with a cochain, given by $$H^n(X; R) \cross H_n(X; R) \to R \\ ([\psi, \alpha]) \mapsto \psi(\alpha)$$

F: X\cross I &\to Y \\
\restrictionof{F}{X\cross\theset{0}} &= f \quad F(x, 0) = f(x) \\
\restrictionof{F}{X\cross\theset{1}} &= g  \quad F(x, 1) = g(x) = y_0\\

- Path

- Path Lifting Property

- Perfect Pairing
	- A pairing alone is an $R\dash$bilinear module map, or equivalently a map out of a tensor product since $p: M\tensor_R N \to L$ can be partially applied to yield $\phi: M \to L^N = \hom_R(N, L)$. A pairing is **perfect** when $\phi$ is an isomorphism.
		- Example: $\det_M: k^2 \cross k^2 \to k$
