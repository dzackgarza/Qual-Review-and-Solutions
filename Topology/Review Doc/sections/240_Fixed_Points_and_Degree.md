# Fixed Points and Degree Theory

Theorem (Lefschetz Fixed Point)
: If $\Lambda_f \neq 0$ then $f$ has a fixed point, where $X\selfmap_f$ and $\Lambda_f = \sum_{k \geq 0} (-1)^k ~\mathrm{Tr}(H_k(X; \QQ) \selfmap_{f_*})$.

Theorem: (Brouwer Fixed Point)
: Every $B^n \selfmap_f$ has a fixed point.

Theorem (Hairy Ball)
: There is no non-vanishing tangent vector field on even dimensional spheres.

Theorem (Borsuk-Ulam)
: For every $S^n \mapsvia{f} \RR^n \exists x\in S^n$ such that $f(x) = f(-x)$.
