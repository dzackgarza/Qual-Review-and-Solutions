# Surfaces and Manifolds


## Euler Characteristics

\todo[inline]{General formula involving genus and nonorientable genus. Presentation of monoid of surfaces}

- Only surfaces with positive $\chi$:
	- $\chi S^2 = 2$
	- $\chi \RP^2 = 1$
	- $\chi B^2 = 1$
- Manifolds with zero $\chi$
	- $T^2, K, M, S^1 \cross I$
- Manifolds with negative $\chi$
	- $\Sigma_{g \geq 2}$ by $\chi(X) = 2-2g$.

## Manifolds


* $H^n(M^n) = \ZZ$ if $M^n$ is orientable and zero if $M^n$ is nonorientable.
* Poincare Duality: $H_i M^n =\cong H^{n-i} M^n$ iff $M^n$ is closed and orientable.
