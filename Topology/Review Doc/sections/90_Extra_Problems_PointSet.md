# Extra Problems

## Basics
- Show that for $A\subseteq X$, $\cl_X(A)$ is the smallest closed subset containing $A$.
- Show that the diagonal map $\Delta(x) = (x, x)$ is continuous.

## Topologies 
- Show that the set $(x, y) \in \RR^2$ such that at least one of $x, y$ is rational with the subspace topology is a connected space.


## Connectedness
- Prove that $X$ is connected iff the only clopen subsets are $\emptyset, X$.
- Show that:
  - Connected does not imply path connected
  - Connected and locally path connected *does* imply path connected
  - Path connected implies connected
- Use the fact that intervals are connected to prove the intermediate value theorem.
- Prove that the continuous image of a connected set is connected.
- Show that if $X$ is locally path connected, then 
  - Every open subset of $X$ is again locally path-connected.
  - $X$ is connected $\iff X$ is path-connected.
  - Every path component of $X$ is a connected component of $X$.
  - Every connected component of $X$ is open in $X$.

## Compactness
- Show that every compact metric space is complete.
- Show that if $X$ is second countable and Hausdorff, or a metric space, then TFAE:
  - $X$ is compact
  - Every infinite subset $A\subseteq X$ has a limit point in $X$.
  - Every sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence in $X$. 
- Show that if $f: A\to B$ is a continuous map between metric spaces and $K\subset A$ is compact, then $\restrictionof{f}{K}$ is uniformly continuous.
- Show that if $f:X\to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is compact then $f(X)$ is compact.
- Show that if $f:X\to \RR$ and $X$ is compact then $f$ is bounded and attains its min/max.
- Show that a finite product or union compact spaces is again compact.
- Show that a quotient of a compact space is again compact.
