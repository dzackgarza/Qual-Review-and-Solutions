# Examples

Sandbox of Spaces

- Finite discrete sets with the discrete topology 
- Subspaces of $\RR$: $(a, b), (a, b], (a, \infty)$, etc.
  - $\ts{0} \union \ts{{1 \over n}\suchthat n\in \ZZ^{\geq 1}}$
- $\QQ$
- The topologist's sine curve
- One-point compactifications
- $\RR^\omega$

Non-Hausdorff spaces:

  - The cofinite topology on any infinite set.
  - $\RR/\QQ$
  - The line with two origins.


## Alternative Topologies

- Discrete
- Cofinite
- Discrete and Indiscrete
- Uniform

The cofinite topology:

- Non-Hausdorff
- Compact

The discrete topology:

- Discrete iff points are open
- Always Hausdorff
- Compact iff finite
- Totally disconnected
- If the domain, every map is continuous

The indiscrete topology:

- Only open sets are $\emptyset, X$
- Non-Hausdorff
- If the codomain, every map is continuous
- Compact
