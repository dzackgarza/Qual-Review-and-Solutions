# Examples

The cofinite topology:

- Non-Hausdorff
- Compact

The discrete topology:

- Discrete iff points are open
- Always Hausdorff
- Compact iff finite
- Totally disconnected
- If the domain, every map is continuous

The indiscrete topology:

- Only open sets are $\emptyset, X$
- Non-Hausdorff
- If the codomain, every map is continuous
- Compact

Non-Hausdorff spaces:

- The cofinite topology on any infinite set.
- $\RR/\QQ$
- The line with two origins.
