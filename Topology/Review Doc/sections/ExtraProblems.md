## Algebraic Topology

### Fundamental Group

- Compute $\pi_1(X)$ where $X \definedas S^2/\sim$, where $x\sim -x$ only for $x$ on the equator $S^1 \injects S^2$.
  - Hint: try cellular homology. Should yield $[\ZZ, \ZZ/2\ZZ, \ZZ, 0, \cdots]$.
- Show that if $X = S^2 \disjoint_\id S^2$ is a pushout along the equators, then $H_n(X) = [\ZZ, 0, \ZZ^3, 0, \cdots]$.

### Covering Spaces

- Describe all connected covering spaces of $\RP^2 \vee \RP^2$.

### Homology

- Compute the homology of the Klein bottle using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence and a decomposition $K = M \disjoint_f M$
- Use the Kunneth formula to compute $H^*(S^2\cross S^2; \ZZ)$.
  - Known to be $[\ZZ, 0, \ZZ^2, 0, \ZZ, 0, 0, \cdots]$.
- Compute $H^*(S^2 \vee S^2 \vee S^4)$
  - Known to be $[\ZZ, 0, \ZZ^2, 0, \ZZ, 0, 0, \cdots]$.
- Show that $\chi(\Sigma_g + \Sigma_h) = \chi(\Sigma_g)  + \chi(\Sigma_h) - 2$.
