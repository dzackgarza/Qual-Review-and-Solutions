1. Compute $\pi_1(X)$ where $X \definedas S^2/\sim$, where $x\sim -x$ only for $x$ on the equator $S^1 \injects S^2$.
  - Hint: try cellular homology. Should yield $[\ZZ, \ZZ/2\ZZ, \ZZ, 0, \cdots]$.
3. Show that a local homeomorphism between compact Hausdorff spaces is a covering space.
4. Describe all connected covering spaces of $\RP^2 \vee \RP^2$.
5. Compute the homology of the Klein bottle using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence and a decomposition $K = M \disjoint_f M$
6. Show that if $X = S^2 \disjoint_\id S^2$ is a pushout along the equators, then $H_n(X) = [\ZZ, 0, \ZZ^3, 0, \cdots]$.
7. Use the Kunneth formula to compute $H^*(S^2\cross S^2; \ZZ)$.
  - Known to be $[\ZZ, 0, \ZZ^2, 0, \ZZ, 0, 0, \cdots]$.
9. Compute $H^*(S^2 \vee S^2 \vee S^4)$
  - Known to be $[\ZZ, 0, \ZZ^2, 0, \ZZ, 0, 0, \cdots]$.

10. Show that $\chi(\Sigma_g + \Sigma_h) = \chi(\Sigma_g)  + \chi(\Sigma_h) - 2$.

1. Let $X$ be a compact space and let $A$ be a closed subspace. 
  Show that $A$ is compact.
2. Let $f : X -> Y$ be a continuous function, with $X$ compact. 
  Show that $f(X)$ is compact.
3. Let $A$ be a compact subspace of a Hausdorff space $X$. 
  Show that $A$ is closed.
4. Show that a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
