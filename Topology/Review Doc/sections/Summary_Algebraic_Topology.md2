**Notation**

- $C_X$
- $\Sigma(X)$
- $\Sigma_g$
- $\iota, \pi$
- $\widehat {i+j}$: for an $n\dash$dimensional manifold, the "dual" dimension $\widehat{i+j} \definedas n - (i+j)$.
Definition (Retract)
: A subspace $A \subset X$ is a *retract* of $X$ iff there exists a continuous map $f: X\to A$ such that $f\mid_{A} = \id_A$. Equivalently it is a *left* inverse to the inclusion.
