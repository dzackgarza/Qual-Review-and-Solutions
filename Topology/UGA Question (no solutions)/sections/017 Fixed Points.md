# Fixed Points

## 1 (Fall '14) $\work$ 
Prove that, for every continuous map $f : B^2 \to B^2$, there is a point $x$ such that $f (x) = x$. 

> This is the $n = 2$ case of the Brouwer fixed point theorem; your proof shouldn't appeal to either of the Brouwer or the Lefschetz fixed point theorems.

## 2 (Spring '18) $\work$ 
Prove or disprove: 

Every continuous map from $S^2$ to $S^2$ has a fixed point.

## 3 (Spring '11) $\work$
a. State the **Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem** for a finite simplicial complex $X$.

b. Use degree theory to prove this theorem in case $X = S^n$.

## 4 (Spring '12) $\work$

### a
Prove that for every continuous map $f : S^2 \to S^2$ there is some $x$ such that either $f (x) = x$ or $f (x) = -x$. 

> Hint: Where $A : S^2 \to S^2$ is the antipodal map, you are being asked to prove that either $f$ or $A \circ f$ has a fixed point.

### b
Exhibit a continuous map $f : S^3 \to S^3$ such that for every $x \in S^3$, $f (x)$ is equal to neither $x$ nor $-x$.

> Hint: It might help to first think about how you could do this for a map from $S^1$ to $S^1$.

## 5 (Spring '14) $\work$ 
Show that a map $S^n \to S^n$ has a fixed point unless its degree is equal to the degree of the antipodal map $a : x \to -x$.

## 6 (Spring '08) $\work$ 
Give an example of a homotopy class of maps of $S^1 \lor  S^1$ each member of which must have a fixed point, and also an example of a map of $S^1 \lor S^1$ which doesn't have a fixed point.

## 7 (Spring '17) $\work$ 
Prove or disprove: 

Every map from $\RP^2 \lor \RP^2$ to itself has a fixed point.

## 8 (Fall '09) $\work$ 
Find all homotopy classes of maps from $S^1 \times \DD^2$ to itself such that every element of the homotopy class has a fixed point.

## 9 (Spring '10) $\work$ 
Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite connected simplicial complexes and let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to X$ be basepoint-preserving maps. 

Show that no matter how you homotope $f \lor g : X \lor Y \to X \lor Y$, there will always be a fixed point.

## 10 (Fall '12) $\work$
Let $f = \id_{\RP^2} \lor \ast$ and $g = \ast \lor id_{S^1}$ be two maps of $\RP^2 \lor S^1$ to itself where $\ast$ denotes the constant map of a space to its basepoint.

Show that one map is homotopic to a map with no fixed points, while the other is not.

## 11 (Spring '09) $\work$ 
View the torus $T$ as the quotient space $\RR^2 /\ZZ^2$. 

Let $A$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix with $\ZZ$ coefficients.

### a
Show that the linear map $A : \RR^2 \to \RR^2$ descends to a continuous map $\mca : T \to T$.

### b
Show that, with respect to a suitable basis for $H_1 (T ; \ZZ)$, the matrix $A$ represents the map induced on $H_1$ by $\mca$.

### c
Find a necessary and sufficient condition on $A$ for $\mca$ to be homotopic to the identity.

### d
Find a necessary and sufficient condition on $A$ for $\mca$ to be homotopic to a map with no fixed points.

## 12 (Spring '19) $\work$ 

### a
Use the Lefschetz fixed point theorem to show that any degree-one map $f : S^2 \to S^2$ has at least one fixed point.

### b
Give an example of a map $f : \RR^2 \to \RR^2$ having no fixed points.

### c
Give an example of a degree-one map $f : S^2 \to S^2$ having exactly one fixed point.

## 13 (Fall '10) $\work$ 
For which compact connected surfaces $\Sigma$ (with or without boundary) does there exist a continuous map $f : \Sigma \to \Sigma$ that is homotopic to the identity and has no fixed point? 

Explain your answer fully.

## 14 (Spring '16) $\work$ 
Use the Brouwer fixed point theorem to show that an $n \times n$ matrix with nonnegative entries has a real eigenvalue.
