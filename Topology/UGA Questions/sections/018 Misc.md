# Miscellaneous Algebraic Topology

## 1 (Fall '14). 
Prove that $\RR^2$ is not homeomorphic to $\RR^n$ for $n > 2$.

## 2 (Spring '12). 
Prove that any finite tree is contractible, where a **tree** is a connected graph that contains no closed edge paths.

## 3 (Spring '13). 
Show that any continuous map $f : \RP^2 \to S^1 \times S^1$ is necessarily null-homotopic.

## 4 (Fall '11). 
Prove that, for $n \geq 2$, every continuous map $f: \RP^n \to S^1$ is null-homotopic.

## 5 (Spring '06). 
Let $S^2 \to \RP^2$ be the universal covering map. 

Is this map null-homotopic? 
Give a proof of your answer.

## 6 (Spring '17). 
Suppose that a map $f : S^3 \times S^3 \to \RP^3$ is not surjective. 

Prove that $f$ is homotopic to a constant function.

## 7 (Fall '06). 
Prove that there does not exist a continuous map $f : S^2 \to S^2$ from the unit sphere in $\RR^3$ to itself such that $f (\vector x) \perp \vector x$ 
(as vectors in $\RR^3$ for all $\vector x \in S^2$).

## 8 (Spring '08). 
Let $f$ be the map of $S^1 \times [0, 1]$ to itself defined by
$$
f (e^{i\theta} , s) = (e^{i(\theta+2\pi s)} , s)
,$$ 
so that $f$ restricts to the identity on the two boundary circles of $S^1 \times [0, 1]$. 

Show that $f$ is homotopic to the identity by a homotopy $f_t$ that is stationary on one of the boundary circles, but not by any homotopy that is stationary on both boundary circles. 

> Hint: Consider what $f$ does to the path $s \mapsto (e^{i\theta_0} , s)$ for fixed $e^{i\theta_0} \in S^1$.

## 9 (Spring '17). 
Show that $S^1 \times S^1$ is not the union of two disks (where there is no assumption that the disks intersect along their boundaries).

## 10 (Spring '14). 
Suppose that $X \subset Y$ and $X$ is a deformation retract of $Y$. 

Show that if $X$ is a path connected space, then $Y$ is path connected.

## 11 (Spring '05). 
Do one of the following:

a. Give (with justification) a contractible subset $X \subset \RR^2$ which is not a retract of $\RR^2$ .

b. Give (with justification) two topological spaces that have the same homology groups but that are not homotopy equivalent.

## 12 (Spring '16). 
Recall that the **suspension** of a topological space, denoted $SX$, is the quotient space formed from $X \times [-1, 1]$ by identifying $(x, 1)$ with $(y, 1)$ for all $x, y \in X$, and also identifying $(x, -1)$ with $(y, -1)$ for all $x, y \in X$.

a. Show that $SX$ is the union of two contractible subspaces.

b. Prove that if $X$ is path-connected then $\pi_1 (SX) = \theset{0}$.

c. For all $n \geq 1$, prove that $H_{n} (X) \cong H_{n+1} (SX)$.
