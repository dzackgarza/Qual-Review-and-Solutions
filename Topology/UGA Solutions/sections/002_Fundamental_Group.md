Proposition:
$\gamma_1 \homotopic \gamma_2 \iff \gamma_1, \gamma_2$ are conjugate in $\pi_1(X, x_0)$, i.e. $\exists [\alpha] \in \pi_1$ such that $[\gamma_1] = [\alpha][\gamma_2][\alpha]\inv$.

Proof:

$\implies$:
Clear, since $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2 \implies [\gamma_1] = [\gamma_2] \in \pi_1(X)$, so take $\alpha(t) = x_0$ the constant loop for all $t$.


$\impliedby$:
? Forgot how these arguments go.

Counterexample where homotopic loops are not equal in $\pi_1$, but just conjugate:
