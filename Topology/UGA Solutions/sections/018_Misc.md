- Any continuous map $\RP^n \mapsvia{f} S^1$ induces a group morphism $\pi_1\RP^n \mapsvia{f_*} \pi_1S^1$
- Identify $\pi_1\RP^n = \ZZ/2\ZZ$ and $\pi_1S^1 = \ZZ$ to obtain a group morphism $f_*: \ZZ/2\ZZ \to \ZZ$.
- Recognizing this as a map of $\ZZ\dash$modules, 
- The image of the generator $[1]_2$ must be sent to an element annihilated by 2
