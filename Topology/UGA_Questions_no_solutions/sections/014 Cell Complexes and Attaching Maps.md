For topological spaces $X, Y$ the **mapping cone** $C(f )$ of a map $f : X \to Y$ is defined to be the quotient space 
\[  
(X \times [0, 1])\disjoint Y / \sim &\qtext{where}  \\ 
(x, 0) &\sim (x', 0) \qtext{for all} x, x' \in X \text{ and } \\ 
(x, 1) &\sim f (x) \qtext{for all } x \in X

(x, 1) \sim f(x)

Let $f: S^1 \mapsvia{\times k} S^1$.

**Claim:**
The inclusion $S^1 \into C_\phi$ induces an isomorphism $\pi_1(C_\phi) \cong \pi_1(S^1) / H$ where $H = N_{\pi_1(S^1)}(\generators{f^*})$ is the normal subgroup generated by the induced map $f^* \pi_1(S^1) \to \pi_1(S^1)$.

- Since $f$ is a $k\dash$fold cover, the induced map is multiplication by $k$ on the generator $\alpha \in \pi_1(S^1)$, i.e. $\alpha \mapsto \alpha^k$.

- But then $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \ZZ$ and $H \cong k\ZZ$, so $\pi_1(C_\phi) \cong \ZZ/m\ZZ$.
