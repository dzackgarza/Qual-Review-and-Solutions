# General Topology

## Topologies, Subspaces, Closures, and Maps

### Fall '11 $\done$

:::{.problem title="Fall 2011"}
Let $X$ be a topological space, and $B \subset A \subset X$. 
Equip $A$ with the subspace topology, and write $\cl_X (B)$ or $\cl_A (B)$ for the closure of $B$ as a subset of, respectively, $X$ or $A$. 

Determine, with proof, the general relationship between $\cl_X (B) \cap A$ and $\cl_A (B)$ 

> I.e., are they always equal? Is one always contained in the other but not conversely? Neither?

:::

:::{.concept}
\envlist

- Definition of closure: for $A\subseteq X$, $\cl_X(A)$ is the intersection of all $B\supseteq A$ which are closed in $X$.
- Definition of "relative" closure: for $A\subseteq Y \subseteq X$, $\Cl_Y(A)$ is the intersection of all $B$ such that $Y\supseteq B \supseteq A$ which are closed in $Y$.
- Closed sets in a subspace: $B' \subseteq Y\subseteq X$ is closed in $Y$ if $B' = B\intersect Y$ for some $B'$ closed in $X$.
:::

:::{.strategy}
What's the picture?
Just need to remember what the closure with respect to a subspace looks like:

![image_2021-05-20-23-58-56](figures/image_2021-05-20-23-58-56.png)
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- Claim: $\Cl_X(A) \intersect  Y = \Cl_Y(A)$.
- Write $\Cl_Y(A)$ as the intersection of $B'$ where $Y\supseteq B' \supseteq A$ with $B'$ closed in $Y$.
- Every such $B'$ is of the form $B' = B \intersect Y$ for some $B$ closed in $X$.
- Just identify the two sides directly by reindexing the intersection:
\[
\Cl_Y(A) 
&\da \Intersect_{\substack{ Y\supseteq B' \supseteq A \\ B' \text{ closed in } Y}} B' \\
&= \Intersect_{\substack{ X \supseteq B \intersect Y \supseteq A \\ B \text{ closed in } X}} \qty{ B \intersect Y } \\
&= \qty{ \Intersect_{\substack{ X \supseteq B \intersect Y \supseteq A \\ B \text{ closed in } X}} B} \intersect Y \\ \\
&\da \Cl_X(A) \intersect Y
.\]

### 6 (Fall '05) $\done$

:::{.problem title="Fall 2005"}
Prove that the unit interval $I$ is compact. Be sure to explicitly state any properties of $\RR$ that you use.


:::

:::{.concept}
\envlist
- Cantor's intersection theorem: for a topological space, any nested sequence of compact nonempty sets has nonempty intersection.
- Bases for standard topology on $\RR$.
- Definition of compactness
:::

:::{.strategy}
What's the picture?
Similar to covering $\ts{1\over n}\union\ts{0}$: cover $x=0$ with one set, which nets all but finitely many points.

![image_2021-05-20-22-46-54](figures/image_2021-05-20-22-46-54.png)

Proceed by contradiction. 
Binary search down into nested intervals, none of which have finite covers.
Get a single point, a single set which eventually contains all small enough nested intervals.
Only need finitely many more opens to cover the rest.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- Toward a contradiction, let $\theset{U_\alpha} \covers [0, 1]$ be an open cover with no finite subcover.
- Then either $[0, {1\over 2}]$ or $[{1\over 2}, 1]$ has no finite subcover; WLOG assume it is $[0, {1\over 2}]$.
- Then either $[0, {1\over 4}]$ or $[{1\over 4}, {1\over 2}]$ has no finite subcover
- Inductively defining $[a_n, b_n]$ this way yields a sequence of compact nested intervals (each with no finite subcover) so Cantor's Nested Interval theorem applies.
- Since $\RR$ is a complete metric space and the diameters $\diam([a_n, b_n]) \leq {1 \over 2^n} \to 0$, the intersection contains exactly one point. 
- Since $p\in [0, 1]$ and the $U_\alpha$ form an open cover, $p\in U_\alpha$ for some $\alpha$.
- Since a basis for $\tau(\RR)$ is given by open intervals, we can find an $\eps>0$ such that $(p-\eps, p+\eps) \subseteq U_\alpha$
- Then if ${1\over 2^N} < \eps$, for $n\geq N$ we have $$[a_n, b_n] \subseteq (p-\eps, p+\eps) \subseteq U_\alpha.$$
- But then $U_\alpha \covers [a_n, b_n]$, yielding a finite subcover of $[a_n, b_n]$, a contradiction.

### 7 (Fall '06). $\work$

:::{.problem title="Fall 2006, 7"}
A topological space is **sequentially compact** if every infinite sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence. 

Prove that every compact metric space is sequentially compact.

:::

### 8 (Fall '10). $\done$

:::{.problem title="Fall 2010, 8"}
Show that for any two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ , $X \cross Y$ is compact if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ are compact.

:::

:::{.concept}
\envlist
- Proof of the tube lemma: 
- Continuous image of compact is compact.
:::


:::{.strategy}
What's the picture?

![image_2021-05-21-01-16-52](figures/image_2021-05-21-01-16-52.png)

Take an open cover of the product, use that vertical fibers are compact to get a finite cover for each fiber.
Use tube lemma to get opens in the base space, run over all $x$ so the tube bases cover $X$.
Use that $X$ is compact to get a finite subcover.

:::


:::{.solution}
\envlist

:::{.proof title="Using the tube lemma without proof"}
$\impliedby$:

- By the universal property, the product $X\cross Y$ is equipped with continuous projections $\pi_X: X\cross Y\to X$ and $\pi_Y: X\cross Y\to X$.
- The continuous image of a compact space is compact, and the images are all of $X$ and $Y$ respectively:
\[
\pi_1(X\cross Y) &= X \\
\pi_2(X\cross Y) &= Y
.\]

$\implies$:

- Let $\ts{U_j} \covers X\cross Y$ be an open cover.
- **Cover a fiber**: fix $x\in X$, the slice $x \cross Y$ is homeomorphic to $Y$ and thus compact 
- Cover it by finitely many elements $\theset{U_j}_{j\leq m} \covers {x} \cross Y$.
  
  > Really, cover $Y$, and then cross with $x$ to cover $x \cross Y$.

  - Set 
\[
N_x \da \Union_{j\leq m} U_j \supseteq x \cross Y
.\]
  - Apply the tube lemma to $N_x$: 
    - Produce a neighborhood $W_x$ of $x$ in $X$ where $W_x \subset N_x$ 
    - This yields a finite cover:
  \[
\ts{U_j}_{j\leq m}\covers N_x \cross Y \supset W_x \cross Y \implies \ts{U_j}_{j\leq m} \covers W_x\cross Y
  .\]
- **Cover the base**: let $x\in X$ vary: for each $x\in X$, produce $W_x \cross Y$ as above, then $\theset{W_x}_{x\in X} \covers X$ where each tube $W_x \cross Y$ is covered by *finitely* many $U_j$.
- Use that $X$ is compact to produce a finite subcover $\theset{W_k}_{k \leq M} \covers X$. 
- Then $\theset{W_k\cross Y}_{k\leq M} \covers X\cross Y$, this is a finite set since each fiber was covered by finitely many opens 
  - Finitely many $k$
  - For each $k$, the tube $W_k \cross Y$ is covered by finitely by $U_j$
  - And finite $\times$ finite = finite.

:::

### 12 (Spring '06). $\work$

:::{.problem title="Spring 2006, 12"}
Write $Y$ for the interval $[0, \infty)$, equipped with the usual topology. 

Find, with proof, all subspaces $Z$ of $Y$ which are retracts of $Y$.
:::

\todo[inline]{Not finished. Add concepts}

:::{.solution}
\envlist
- Using the fact that $[0, \infty) \subset \RR$ is Hausdorff, any retract must be closed, so any closed interval $[\eps, N]$ for $0\leq \eps \leq N \leq \infty$. 
  - Note that $\eps = N$ yields all one point sets $\theset{x_0}$ for $x_0 \geq 0$.
- No finite discrete sets occur, since the retract of a connected set is connected.
:::

### 13 (Fall '06). $\work$

:::{.problem title="Fall 2006, 13"}
\envlist

a.
Prove that if the space $X$ is connected and locally path connected then $X$ is path connected.

b.
Is the converse true? Prove or give a counterexample.

:::

### 14 (Fall '07) $\work$

:::{.problem title="?"}
Let $\theset{X_\alpha \mid \alpha \in A}$ be a family of connected subspaces of a space $X$ such that there is a point $p \in X$ which is in each of the $X_\alpha$.

Show that the union of the $X_\alpha$ is connected.

:::

\todo[inline]{Proof 2 not complete?}

:::{.solution}

\envlist

:::{.proof title="Variant 1"}

- Take two connected sets $X, Y$; then there exists $p\in X\intersect Y$.
- Toward a contradiction: write $X\union Y = A \disjoint B$ with both $A, B \subset A\disjoint B$ open.
-   Since $p\in X \union Y = A\disjoint B$, WLOG $p\in A$. 
    We will show $B$ must be empty.
- Claim: $A\intersect X$ is clopen in $X$.
  - $A\intersect X$ is open in $X$: ?
  - $A\intersect X$ is closed in $X$: ?
- The only clopen sets of a connected set are empty or the entire thing, and since $p\in A$, we must have $A\intersect X = X$.
- By the same argument, $A\intersect Y = Y$.
- So $A\intersect \qty{X\union Y} = \qty{A\intersect X} \union \qty{A\intersect Y} = X\union Y$
- Since $A\subset X\union Y$, $A\intersect \qty{X\union Y} = A$
- Thus $A = X\union Y$, forcing $B = \emptyset$.


:::

:::{.proof title="Variant 2"}

Let $X \definedas \union_\alpha X_\alpha$, and let $p\in \intersect X_\alpha$.
Suppose toward a contradiction that $X = A \disjoint B$ with $A,B$ nonempty, disjoint, and relatively open as subspaces of $X$.
Wlog, suppose $p\in A$, so let $q\in B$ be arbitrary.

Then $q\in X_\alpha$ for some $\alpha$, so $q\in B \intersect X_\alpha$.
We also have $p\in A \intersect X_\alpha$.

But then these two sets disconnect $X_\alpha$, which was assumed to be connected --  a contradiction.

:::

:::

### 5 (Fall '04). $\work$

:::{.problem title="?"}
Let $X$ be a topological space.

a.  
Prove that $X$ is connected if and only if there is no continuous
nonconstant map to the discrete two-point space $\theset{0, 1}$.

b.
Suppose in addition that $X$ is compact and $Y$ is a connected Hausdorff space. 
Suppose further that there is a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ such that 
every preimage $f\inv (y)$ for $y \in Y$, is a connected subset of $X$. 

Show that $X$ is connected.

c.  
Give an example showing that the conclusion of (b) may be false if
$X$ is not compact.

:::

### ? (Spring '10) $\done$

:::{.problem title="?"}
If $X$ is a topological space and $S \subset X$, define in terms of
open subsets of $X$ what it means for $S$ **not** to be connected. 

Show that if $S$ is not connected there are nonempty subsets $A, B \subset X$ 
such that 
$$
A \cup B = S \qtext{and} A \cap \bar B = \bar A \cap B = \emptyset
$$ 

> Here $\bar A$ and $\bar B$ denote closure with respect to the topology on the ambient space $X$.

:::

:::{.concept}
\envlist
- Lemma: $X$ is connected iff the only subsets of $X$ that are closed and open are $\emptyset, X$.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

:::{.proof title="Variant 1"}
\envlist

- $S\subset X$ is **not ** connected if $S$ with the subspace topology is not connected.
  - I.e. there exist $A, B \subset S$ such that 
    - $A, B \neq \emptyset$,
    - $A\intersect B = \emptyset$,
    - $A \disjoint B = S$.
- Or equivalently, there exists a nontrivial $A\subset S$ that is clopen in $S$.

Show stronger statement: this is an iff.

$\implies$:

- Suppose $S$ is not connected; we then have sets $A \union B = S$ from above and it suffices to show $\cl_Y(A) \intersect B = A \intersect \cl_X(B) = \emptyset$. 
- $A$ is open by assumption and $Y\setminus A = B$ is closed in $Y$, so $A$ is clopen.
- Write $\cl_Y(A) \definedas \cl_X(A) \intersect Y$.
- Since $A$ is closed in $Y$, $A = \cl_Y(A)$ by definition, so $A = \cl_Y(A) = \cl_X(A) \intersect Y$.
- Since $A\intersect B = \emptyset$, we then have $\cl_Y(A) \intersect B = \emptyset$.
- The same argument applies to $B$, so $\cl_Y(B) \intersect A = \emptyset$.

$\impliedby$:

- Suppose displayed condition holds; given such $A, B$ we will show they are clopen in $Y$.
- Since $\cl_Y(A) \intersect B = \emptyset$, (claim) we have $\cl_Y(A) = A$ and thus $A$ is closed in $Y$.
  - Why?
  \begin{align*}
  \cl_Y(A) &\definedas \cl_X(A) \intersect Y \\ 
  &= \cl_X(A) \intersect \qty{A\disjoint B} \\ 
  &= \qty{\cl_X(A) \intersect A} \disjoint \qty{\cl_X(A) \intersect B} \\
  &= A  \disjoint \qty{\cl_X(A) \intersect B} 
  \quad\text{since } A \subset \cl_Y(A) \\
  &= A \disjoint \qty{\cl_Y(A) \intersect B} 
  \quad \text{since } B \subset Y \\
  &= A \disjoint \emptyset \quad\text{using the assumption} \\
  &= A
  .\end{align*}
- But $A = Y\setminus B$ where $B$ is closed, so $A$ is open and thus a nontrivial clopen subset.

:::{.proof title="Variant 2"}
\envlist

If $S\subset X$ is not connected, then there exists a subset $A\subset S$ that is both open and closed in the subspace topology, where $A\neq \emptyset, S$.

Suppose $S$ is not connected, then choose $A$ as above.
Then $B = S\setminus A$ yields a pair $A, B$ that disconnects $S$.
Since $A$ is closed in $S$, $\bar A = A$ and thus $\bar A \cap B = A \cap B = \emptyset$.
Similarly, since $A$ is open, $B$ is closed, and $\bar B = B \implies \bar B \cap A = B \cap A = \emptyset$.

1. $\RR\in \tau$ since $\RR\setminus \RR = \emptyset$ is trivially a finite set, and $\emptyset \in \tau$ by definition.
2. If $U_i \in \tau$ then $(\union_i U_i)^c = \intersect U_i^c$ is an intersection of finite sets and thus finite, so $\union_i U_i \in \tau$.
3. If $U_i \in \tau$, then $(\intersect_{i=1}^n U_i)^c = \union_{i=1}^n U_i^c$ is a finite union of finite sets and thus finite, so $\intersect U_i \in \tau$.

So $\tau$ forms a topology.

To see that $(\RR, \tau)$ is compact, let $\theset{U_i} \rightrightarrows \RR$ be an open cover by elements in $\tau$.

Fix any $U_\alpha$, then $U_\alpha^c = \theset{p_1, \cdots, p_n}$ is finite, say of size $n$.
So pick $U_1 \ni p_1, \cdots, U_n \ni p_n$; then $\RR \subset U_\alpha \union_{i=1}^n U_i$ is a finite cover.

- In the subspace topology, $U_i$ is given by some $V\in \tau(\RR)$ such that $V\intersect X = U_i$
  - A basis for the subspace topology on $\RR$ is open intervals, so write $V$ as a union of open intervals $V = \union_{k\in K} I_k$.
  - Since $0\in U_j$, $0\in I_k$ for some $k$.
- Since $I_k$ is an interval, it contains infinitely many points of the form $x_n = {1 \over n} \in X$
- Then $I_k \intersect X \subset U_j$ contains infinitely many such points.
- So there are only *finitely* many points in $X\setminus U_j$, each of which is in $U_{j(n)}$ for some $j(n) \in J$ depending on $n$.

Statement: show that the *Lebesgue number* is well-defined for compact metric spaces.

> Note: this is a question about the *Lebesgue Number*. See Wikipedia for detailed proof.

- Write $U = \theset{U_i \suchthat i\in I}$, then $X \subseteq \union_{i\in I} U_i$. Need to construct a $\delta > 0$.
- By compactness of $X$, choose a finite subcover $U_1, \cdots, U_n$.
- Define the distance between a point $x$ and a set $Y\subset X$: $d(x, Y) = \inf_{y\in Y} d(x, y)$.
  - **Claim**: the function $d(\wait, Y): X\to \RR$ is continuous for a fixed set.
  - Proof: Todo, not obvious.

![](figures/image_2020-05-22-00-24-45.png)

- Define a function
\begin{align*}
f: X &\to \RR \\
x &\mapsto {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^n d(x, X\setminus U_i) 
.\end{align*}
  - Note this is a sum of continuous functions and thus continuous.


- **Claim**: $$\delta \definedas \inf_{x\in X}f(x) = \min_{x\in X}f(x) = f(x_{\text{min}}) > 0$$ suffices.
  - That the infimum is a minimum: $f$ is a continuous function on a compact set, apply the extreme value theorem: it attains its minimum.
  - That $\delta > 0$: otherwise, $\delta = 0 \implies \exists x_0$ such that $d(x_0, X\setminus U_i) = 0$ for all $i$.
    - Forces $x_0 \in X\setminus U_i$ for all $i$, but $X\setminus \union U_i = \emptyset$ since the $U_i$ cover $X$.
  - That it satisfies the Lebesgue condition:
  $$\forall x\in X, \exists i \qtext{such that} B_\delta(x) \subset U_i$$
    - Let $B_\delta(x) \ni x$; then by minimality $f(x) \geq \delta$.
    - Thus it can *not* be the case that $d(x, X\setminus U_i) < \delta$ for *every* $i$, otherwise 
    $$f(x) \leq {1\over n}\qty{ \delta + \cdots + \delta} = {n\delta \over n} = \delta$$
    - So there is some particular $i$ such that $d(x, X\setminus U_i) \geq \delta$.
    - But then $B_\delta \subseteq U_i$ as desired.

- Then 
  \begin{align*}
  m> 0 \iff d(x_0, f(x_0)) > 0 \iff x_0 \neq f(x_0)

- Now apply $f$ and use the assumption that $f$ is a contraction to contradict minimality of $m$:
\begin{align*}

&\leq C\cdot d(f(x_0), x_0) \\ 
&< d(f(x_0), x_0) \quad\text{since } C<1\\
&\leq m

- Proof that $g$ is continuous: use the definition of $g$, the triangle inequality, and that $f$ is a contraction:
\begin{align*}
d(x, f(x)) &\leq d(x, y) + d(y, f(y)) + d(f(x), f(y)) \\
\implies d(x, f(x)) - d(y, f(y)) &\leq d(x, y) + d(f(x), f(y)) \\
\implies g(x) - g(y) &\leq d(x, y) + C\cdot d(x, y)  = (C+1) \cdot d(x, y)\\

$\implies$:

If $X$ is totally bounded, let $\varepsilon  = \frac 1 n$ for each $n$, and let $\theset{x_i}$ be an arbitrary sequence.
For $n=1$, pick a finite open cover $\theset{U_i}_n$ such that $\diam{U_i} < \frac 1 n$ for every $i$.

Choose $V_1$ such that there are infinitely many $x_i \in V_1$. (Why?)
Note that $\diam V_i < 1$.
Now choose $x_i \in V_1$ arbitrarily and define it to be $y_1$.

Then since $V_1$ is totally bounded, repeat this process to obtain $V_2 \subseteq V_1$ with $\diam(V_2)< \frac 1 2$, and choose $x_i \in V_2$ arbitrarily and define it to be $y_2$.

This yields a nested family of sets $V_1 \supseteq V_2 \supseteq \cdots$ and a sequence $\theset{y_i}$ such that $d(y_i, y_j) < \max(\frac 1 i, \frac 1 j) \to 0$, so $\theset{y_i}$ is a Cauchy subsequence.

$\impliedby$:

Then fix $\varepsilon > 0$ and pick $x_1$ arbitrarily and define $S_1 = B(\varepsilon, x_1)$.
Then pick $x_2 \in S_1^c$ and define $S_2 = S_1 \union B(\varepsilon, x_2)$, and so on.
Continue by picking $x_{n+1} \in S_n^c$ (Since $X$ is not totally bounded, this can always be done) and defining $S_{n+1} = S_n \union B(\varepsilon, x_{n+1})$.

Then $\theset{x_n}$ is not Cauchy, because $d(x_i, x_j) > \varepsilon$ for every $i\neq j$.

Take $X = C^0([0, 1])$ with the sup-norm, then $f_n(x) = x^n$ are all bounded by 1, but $\norm{f_i - f_j} = 1$ for every $i, j$, so no subsequence can be Cauchy, so $X$ can not be totally bounded.

Moreover, $\theset{f_n}$ is closed. (Why?)

- Second counterexample: $(\RR, (x,y) \mapsto \frac{\abs{x-y}}{1 + \abs{x-y}})$. 

- Best counterexample: $X = \left(\ZZ, ~\rho ( x , y ) = \left\{ \begin{array} { l l } { 1 } & { \text { if } x \neq y } \\ { 0 } & { \text { if } x = y } \end{array} \right.\right)$. This metric makes $X$ complete for any $X$, then take $\NN \subset X$. All sets are closed, and bounded, so we have a complete, closed, bounded set that is not compact -- take that cover $U_i = B(1, i)$.

$X$ is connected:

- Write $X = L\disjoint G$ where $L = \theset{0} \cross [-1, 1]$ and $G = \theset{\Gamma(\sin(x)) \suchthat x\in (0, 1]}$ is the graph of $\sin(x)$.
- $L \cong [0, 1]$ which is connected
  - Claim: Every interval is connected (todo)
- Claim: $G$ is connected (i.e. as the graph of a continuous function on a connected set)
  - The function 
  \begin{align*}
  f: (0, 1] &\to [-1, 1] \\
  x &\mapsto \sin(x)
  \end{align*}
  is continuous (how to prove?)
  - Products of continuous functions are continuous iff all of the components are continuous.
  - Claim: The diagonal map $\Delta: Y\to Y\cross Y$ where $\Delta(t) = (t, t)$ is continuous for any $Y$ since $\Delta = (\id, \id)$
    - Product of identity functions, which are continuous.
  - The composition of continuous function is continuous, therefore
  \begin{align*}
  F : (0, 1] &\mapsvia{\Delta} (0, 1]^2 \mapsvia{(\id, f)} (0, 1] \cross [-1, 1]  \\
  t &\mapsto (t, t) \mapsto (t, f(t))
  \end{align*}
  - Then $G = F((0, 1])$ is the continuous image of a connected set and thus connected.

- Claim: $X$ is connected
  - Suppose there is a disconnecting cover $X = A\disjoint B$ such that $\bar A \intersect B = A\intersect \bar B = \emptyset$ and $A, B \neq \emptyset$.
  - WLOG let $(x, \sin(x))\in B$ for $x>0$ (otherwise just relabeling $A, B$)
  - Claim: $B = G$
    - It can't be the case that $A$ intersects $G$: otherwise $$X = A\disjoint B \implies G = (A\intersect G) \disjoint (B \intersect V)$$ disconnects $G$. 
      So $A\intersect G = \emptyset$, forcing $A \subseteq L$
    - Similarly $L$ can not be disconnected, so $B\intersect L = \emptyset$ forcing $B \subset G$
    - So $A \subset L$ and $B\subset G$, and since $X = A\disjoint B$, this forces $A = L$ and $B = G$.
  - But any open set $U$ in the subspace topology $L\subset \RR^2$ (generated by open balls) containing $(0, 0) \in L$ is the restriction of a ball $V \subset \RR^2$ of radius $r>0$, i.e. $U = V \intersect X$. 
    - But any such ball contains points of $G$: $$n\gg 0 \implies {1 \over n\pi} < r \implies \exists g\in G \text{ s.t. } g\in U.$$
    - So $U \intersect L \intersect G \neq \emptyset$, contradicting $L\intersect G = \emptyset$.

- Claim: $X$ is *not* path-connected.
  - Todo: "can't get from $L$ to $G$ in finite time".
  - Toward a contradiction, choose a continuous function $f:I \to X$ with $f(0) \in G$ and $f(1) \in L$.
    - Since $L \cong [0, 1]$, use path-connectedness to create a path $f(1) \to (0, 1)$
    - Concatenate paths and reparameterize to obtain $f(1) = (0, 1) \in L \subset \RR^2$.
  - Let $\eps = {1\over 2}$; by continuity there exists a $\delta\in I$ such that 
    $$
    t\in B_\delta(1) \subset I \implies f(t) \in B_\eps(\vector 0) \in X
    $$
  - Using the fact that $[1-\delta, 1]$ is connected, $f([1-\delta, 1]) \subset X$ is connected.
  - Let $f(1-\delta) = \vector x_0 = (x_0, y_0) \subset X\subset \RR^2$.
  - Define a composite map 
    \begin{align*}
    F: [0, 1] &\to \RR
    F &\definedas \pr_{x\dash\text{axis}} \circ f
    .\end{align*}

    - $F$ is continuous as a composition of continuous functions.
  - Then $F([1-\delta, 1]) \subset \RR$ is connected and thus must be an interval $(a, b)$
  - Since $f(1) = \vector 0$ which has $x\dash$component zero, $[0, b] \subset (a, b)$.
  - Since $f(1-\delta) = \vector x$, $F(\vector x) = x_0$ and this $[0, x_0] \subset (a, b)$.
  - Thus for all $x \in (0, x_0]$ there exists a $t\in [1-\delta, 1]$ such that $f(t) = (x, \sin\qty{1\over x})$.
  - Now toward the contradiction, choose $x = {1 \over 2n\pi - \pi/2} \in \RR$ with $n$ large enough such that $x\in (0, x_0)$.
    - Note that $\sin\qty{1\over x} = -1$ by construction.
    - Apply the previous statement: there exists a $t$ such that $f(t) = (x, \sin\qty{1\over x}) = (x, -1)$.
    - But then 
      $$
      \norm{f(t) - f(x)} = \norm{(x, -1) - (0, 1)} = \norm{(x, 2)} > {1\over 2}
      ,$$
      contradicting continuity of $f$.

:::{.proof title="Variant 2"}
Let $X = A \union B$ with $A = \theset{(0, y) \suchthat y\in [-1, 1] }$ and $B = \theset{(x, \sin(1/x)) \suchthat x\in (0, 1]}$.
Since $B$ is the graph of a continuous function, which is always connected.
Moreover, $X = \bar{A}$, and the closure of a connected set is still connected.

:::{.proof title="?"}
Alternative direct argument: the subspace $X' = B \union \theset{\vector 0}$ is not connected. 
If it were, write $X' = U \disjoint V$, where wlog $\vector 0 \in U$.
Then there is an open such that $\vector 0 \in N_r(\vector 0) \subset U$.
But any neighborhood about zero intersects $B$, so we must have $V \subset B$ as a strict inclusion.
But then $U \intersect B$ and $V$ disconnects $B$, a connected set, which is a contradiction.

:::

To see that $X$ is not path-connected, suppose toward a contradiction that there is a continuous function $f: I \to X \subset \RR^2$.
In particular, $f$ is continuous at $\vector 0$, and so

\begin{align*}
\forall \varepsilon \quad \exists \delta \suchthat \norm{\vector x} < \delta \implies \norm{f(\vector x)} < \varepsilon
.\end{align*}

where the norm is the standard Euclidean norm. 

However, we can pick $\varepsilon < 1$, say, and consider points of the form $\vector x_n = (\frac{1}{2n\pi}, 0)$.
In particular, we can pick $n$ large enough such that $\norm{\vector x_n}$ is as small as we like, whereas $\norm{f(\vector x_n)} = 1 > \varepsilon$ for all $n$, a contradiction.

- Let $A \subset X$ be compact, and pick a fixed $x\in X\setminus A$.
- Since $X$ is Hausdorff, for arbitrary $a\in A$, there exists opens $U_{a} \ni a$ and $U_{x,a}\ni x$ such that $V_{a} \intersect U_{x,a} = \emptyset$.
- Then $\theset{U_{a} \suchthat a\in A} \rightrightarrows A$, so by compactness there is a finite subcover $\theset{U_{a_i}} \rightrightarrows A$.

- Now take $U = \union_i U_{a_i}$ and $V_x = \intersect_i V_{a_i, x}$, so $U\intersect V = \emptyset$.
  - Note that both $U$ and $V_x$ are open.

- But then defining $V \definedas \union_{x\in X\setminus A} V_x$, we have $X\setminus A \subset V$ and $V\intersect A = \emptyset$, so $V = X\setminus A$, which is open and thus $A$ is closed.

Note that any finite space is clearly compact.

Any map into an indiscrete topology is continuous, and $f$ is clearly a bijection.

Now $A_K, B_K$ is a disconnection of $K$.
Let $s = \sup(A_K)$, which exists since $\RR$ is complete and has the LUB property
Claim: $s \in \cl_I(A_K)$. Proof:
  - If $s\in A_K$ there's nothing to show since $A_K \subset \cl_I(A_K)$, so assume $s\in I\setminus A_K$.
  - Now let $N_s$ be an arbitrary neighborhood of $s$, then using ??? we can find an $\eps>0$ such that $B_\eps(s) \subset N_s$

  - But then $a \in B_\eps(s)$ and $a\in N_s$ with $a\neq s$.
  - Since $N_s$ was arbitrary, every $N_s$ contains a point of $A_K$ not equal to $s$, so $s$ is a limit point by definition.
Since $s\in \cl_I(A_K)$ and $\cl_I(A_K)\intersect B_K = \emptyset$, we have $s\not \in B_K$.
Then the subinterval $(x, b] \intersect A_K = \emptyset$ for every $x>c$ since $c \definedas \sup A_K$.
But since $A_K \disjoint B_K = K$, we must have $(x, b] \subset B_K$, and thus $s\in \cl_I(B_K)$.
Since $A_K, B_K$ were assumed disconnecting, $s\not \in A_K$

:::{.problem title="?"}
Let $S^1$ denote the unit circle in $C$, $X$ be any topological space, $x_0 \in X$, and $$\gamma_0, \gamma_1 : S^1 \to X$$ be two continuous maps such that $\gamma_0 (1) = \gamma_1 (1) = x_0$.

Prove that $\gamma_0$ is homotopic to $\gamma_1$ if and only if the elements represented by $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ in $\pi_1 (X, x_0 )$ are conjugate.

- Any two maps $f_i: Y\to X$ are **homotopic** iff there exists a homotopy $H: I\cross Y \to X$ with $H_0 = f_0$ and $H_1 = f_1$.
- $\pi_1(X; x_0)$ is the set of maps $f:S^1\to X$ such that $f(0) = f(1) = x_0$, modulo being homotopic maps.
- Loops can be homotopic (i.e. *freely* homotopic) without being homotopic rel a base point, so not equal in $\pi_1(X; x_0)$.
  - Counterexample where homotopic loops are not equal in $\pi_1$, but just conjugate.
    Need nonabelian $\pi_1$ for conjugates to possibly not be equal, so take a torus:

$\implies$:

- Suppose $\gamma_1 \homotopic \gamma_2$, then there exists a free homotopy $H: I\cross S^1 \to X$ with $H_0 = \gamma_0, H_1 = \gamma_1$.
- Since $H(0, 1) \gamma_0(1) = x_0$ and $H(1, 1) = \gamma_1(1) =  x_0$, the map
\[
T: [0, 1] &\to X \\
t &\mapsto H(t, 1)
\]
  descends to a loop $T:S^1\to X$.
- Claim: $\gamma_1$ and $T\ast \gamma_2 \ast T\inv$ are homotopic rel $x_0$, making $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ conjugate in $\pi_1$.
  - Idea: for each fixed $s$, follow $T$ for the first third, $\gamma_2$ for the middle third, $T\inv$ for the last third.

  ![Image](figures/2020-02-04-20:23.png)


$\impliedby$:

- Suppose $[\gamma_1] = [h] [\gamma_2] [h]\inv$ in $\pi_1(X; x_0)$.
  The claim is that $\gamma_1 \homotopic h\gamma_2 h\inv$ are freely homotopic.
- Since these are equal in $\pi_1$, we get a square interpolating $\gamma_1$ and $h\gamma_2 h\inv$ with constant sides $\id_{x_0}$.
- For free homotopies, the sides don't have to be constant, to merge $h$ and $h\inv$ into the sides to get a free homotopy from $f$ to $g$:

$\pi$ clearly induces a map $p_*$ on $\pi_1$ by functoriality, so we'll show that $\ker p_*$ is trivial.
Let $\gamma: S^1 \to \tilde X \in \pi_1(\tilde X)$ and suppose $\alpha \definedas p_*(\gamma) = [e] \in \pi_1(X)$. 
We'll show $\gamma \homotopic [e]$ in $\pi_1(\tilde X)$.


Since $\alpha = [e]$, $\alpha \homotopic \const$ and thus there is a homotopy $H: I\cross S^1 \to X$ such that $H_0 = \const(x_0)$ and $H_1 = \gamma$.
By the HLP, this lifts to $\tilde H: I\cross S^1 \to \tilde X$.
Noting that $\pi\inv(\const(x_0))$ is still a constant loop, this says that $\gamma$ is homotopic to a constant loop and thus nullhomotopic. 

c.

Since both spaces are path-connected, the degree o the covering map $\pi$ is precisely the index of the included fundamental group.
This forces $\pi$ to be a degree 1 covering and hence a homeomorphism.

Note $\pi_1 \RP^2 = \ZZ/2\ZZ$, so $\pi_1 X = (\ZZ/2\ZZ)^2$.

The pullback of any neighborhood of the basepoint needs to be locally homeomorphic to one of

- $S^2 \vee S^2$
- $\RP^2 \vee S^2$

And so *all* possibilities for regular covering spaces are given by

- $\bigvee^{2k} S^2$ "beads" wrapped into a necklace for any $k \geq 1$
- $\RP^2 \vee (\bigvee^k S^2) \vee \RP^2$
- $\vee^\infty S^2$, the universal cover

  \[  
  0 = [2]_2 = 2\cdot [1]_2  \implies 0 = f_*(0) = 2\cdot f_*([1]_2)

    since $\ZZ\dash$module maps send 0 to 0.
