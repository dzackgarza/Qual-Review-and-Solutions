# Paper on Chow Rings

- Reference: a recent result, [Chow Rings computed in 2005 for $BGL_n, BSL_n, BSp_n, BO_n, BSO_n$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0505560.pdf)

Cohomology for classifying spaces of linear algebraic groups (equivalently compact Lie Groups) have an algebraic analog: Chow rings of the classifying spaces. For a finite abelian group, the chow ring is the symmetric algebra on the group of characters.

There is a map from the Chow ring back into cohomology, which in general fails surjectivity and injectivity. Tensoring this map with $\QQ$ creates an isomorphism, though. In this case, both have the ring structure of invariants under the Weyl group in the symmetric algebra of the ring of characters of a maximal torus. (Classical result, Leray and Borel.)

Chow rings have not been computed for $PGL_n$. Need to know about Chern classes, Euler classes,

$A_*$ known for all $O_n$ and $SO_n$ for $n$ odd in 80s, general result for $SO_n$ 2004. $PGL_n$ case is much harder. Understood for $n=2$, since $PGL_2 \cong SO_3$. Other bits that have been computed: $H^*(BPGL_3, \ZZ_3), H^*(BPGL_n, \ZZ_2)$ for $n = 2 \mod 4$ in 70s/80s, incomplete results for $H^*(BPGL_p, \ZZ_p)$ in 2003.
