- The chromatic view-point, which studies stable homotopy theory via its relationships to the moduli of formal groups, and related topics such as topological modular forms, use a sizable amount of (fairly abstract) algebraic geometry. And Lurie's work on derived algebraic geometry was motivated in part by establishing foundations adequate to the task of defining equivariant forms of TMF.

[Behrens Hopkins Hill](https://www3.nd.edu/~mbehren1/papers/exotic2.pdf)
A homotopy n-sphere is a smooth n-manifold which is homotopy equivalent to
$S^n$. Kervaire and Milnor defined Θn to be the group of homotopy spheres up
to h-cobordism (where the group operation is given by connect sum). By the
h-cobordism theorem [Sma62] (n > 4) and Perelman’s proof of the Poincare conjecture [Per02], [Per03a], [Per03b] (n = 3), for n 6= 4, Θn = 0 if and only if $S^n$ has
a unique differentiable structure (i.e. there are no exotic spheres of dimension n).

We wish to consider the following question: For which n is Θn = 0?

The general belief is that there should be finitely many such n, and these n should
be concentrated in relatively low dimensions.

The chromatic tower. Fix a prime p. The chromatic tower of a spectrum X is
the tower of Bousfield localizations
$$
X \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X _ { E ( n ) } \rightarrow X _ { E ( n - 1 ) } \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X _ { E ( 0 ) }
$$
where E(n) is the nth Johnson-Wilson spectrum (E(0) = HQ, by convention) with
$$
E ( n ) _ { * } = \mathbb { Z } _ { ( p ) } \left[ v _ { 1 } , \dots , v _ { n - 1 } , v _ { n } ^ { \pm } \right]
$$
The fibers of the chromatic tower
$$
M _ { n } X \rightarrow X _ { E ( n ) } \rightarrow X _ { E ( n - 1 ) }
$$
are called the monochromatic layers. The spectral sequence associated to the chromatic tower is the chromatic spectral sequence
$$
E _ { 1 } ^ { n , * } = \pi _ { * } M _ { n } X \Rightarrow \pi _ { * } X _ { ( p ) }
$$

Let Mell denote the Deligne-Mumford stack of elliptic curves (over Spec(Z)). For
a commutative ring R, the groupoid of R-points of Mell is the groupoid of elliptic
curves over R. This stack carries a line bundle ω where for an elliptic curve C, the
fiber of ω over C is given by
$$ωC = T^∗_e C,$$
the tangent space of C at its basepoint e.
The stack $M_{ell}$ admits a compactification $\overline{M}_{ell}$ whose R points are generalized
elliptic curves. The space of integral modular
forms of weight k is defined to be the sections
$$
H ^ { 0 } \left( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { e l l } , \omega ^ { \otimes k } \right)
$$
Motivated by the definition of integral modular forms and this descent spectral
sequence in the case of U = Mell , the spectrum Tmf is defined to be the global
sections
$$
\mathrm { Tmf } : = \mathcal { O } ^ { t o p } \left( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { e l l } \right)
$$
