- "Etale groups schemes are entirely determined by their geometric points."
- The basic idea for deformation theory is to understand when an object $X/S$ for $S$ a scheme lifts to an infinitesimal neighborhood of $S$.
  - Example: When does an elliptic curve $E/\ZZ_p$ lift to an elliptic scheme $\mathcal E / \ZZ_p$?
- "Deformation theory for ‘blah’s is the study of smoothness for the moduli space of ‘blah’s."
- "The deformation theory of an abelian scheme coincides with the deformation theory of its $p$-divisible group."
- $p\dash$divisible groups are systems (of finite, flat group schemes) in which each piece is the torsion of the following piece.
