The universal compact lie group is the topological monoid $L(\RR^\infty, \RR^\infty)$ of linear isometric self-embeddings.

Here is a very fundamental way to create interesting Riemannian manifolds: Let $G$ be a semi-simple Lie group, let $K$ be its maximal compact subgroup, let $Γ$ be a discrete subgroup of $G$, and form $G/K$. This quotient is called the symmetric space attached to $G$.

The Riemannian structure comes from an invariant metric on $G$, and so $G$ acts as isometries on $G/K$ by left translation.

If you now take a discrete subgroup $Γ$ of $G$, you can form the double quotient $Γ∖G/K$. These are some of the most celebrated Riemannian manifolds in mathematics. In the case of $SL_2(\RR)$, we know via uniformization that all genus $g≥2$ Riemann surfaces can be described in this way. In the case of $SL_2(\CC)$ we get hyperbolic 3-manifolds, from symplectic groups we get moduli spaces of abelian varieties, ... .

P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces $Γ∖G/K$ for certain $Γ$ (so-called congruence subgroups) is one of the basic topics of the Langlands program, and the function theory and cohomology of these spaces (especially their representation-theoretic structure) is conjectured to govern a vast amount of number theory. Trying to understand and work on these conjectures was my own motivation for learning Lie theory.

A Klein geometry consists of a Lie group $G$ together with a Lie subgroup $H$ of $G$. Together $G$ and $H$ determine a homogeneous space $G/H$, on which the group $G$ acts by left-translation. Klein's aim was then to study objects living on the homogeneous space which were congruent by the action of $G$. A Cartan geometry extends the notion of a Klein geometry by attaching to each point of a manifold a copy of a Klein geometry, and to regard this copy as tangent to the manifold. Thus the geometry of the manifold is infinitesimally identical to that of the Klein geometry, but globally can be quite different. In particular, Cartan geometries no longer have a well-defined action of $G$ on them. However, a Cartan connection supplies a way of connecting the infinitesimal model spaces within the manifold by means of parallel transport.

- Irreducible reps of $SO_3$ describe the periodic table
- Irreducible reps of $SU_2$ lead to Dirac equations of the electron
- Standard Model: $SU_3 \cross SU_2 \cross U_1$

$SO(n)$ and its relativistic analog $SO(1,n)$ define symmetries of space time. $SU(n)$ defines fundamental quantum mechanical phase space symmetries. $Sp(n)$ defines symmetries in cases where there is a quaternionic structure.
