Neat trick from algebraic geometry: For a stack $\mathcal M =X/G$ where $X$ is a $\CC\dash$variety and $G$ is a finite group, then
$$
H^\wait(\mathcal M; \QQ) \cong \left( H^\wait(X; \QQ)\right)^G
$$
where the RHS denotes the taking the $G\dash$ invariant part. Seems to only work over $\QQ$. The quotient is scheme-theoretic. The actual definite involves equivariant cohomology.
