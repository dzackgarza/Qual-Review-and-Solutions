Stacks and orbifolds are concepts from algebraic geometry (respectively geometric topology) that allow us to talk about objects that locally look like the quotient of a smooth object by a group action, in a way that remembers information about the isotropy groups of the action.  Such 'stacky' objects can behave like smooth  objects  even  if  the  underlying  spaces  have  singularities.   As  for  spaces,  manifolds,and schemes, cohomology theories are important invariants also for stacks and orbifolds, and examples such as ordinary cohomology or K-theory lend themselves to generalization.  Special cases of orbifolds are 'global quotients', often denoted M/G, for example for a smooth action of a compact Lie group G on a smooth manifold M.  In such examples, the orbifold cohomology of M/G is supposed to be the G-equivariant cohomology of M.  This suggests away to do orbifold cohomology theories by means of equivariant stable homotopy theory,via suitable G-spectra.  However, since the group G is not intrinsic and can vary, one needs equivariant cohomology theories for all groups G, with some compatibility.  Global homotopy theory makes this idea precise.
