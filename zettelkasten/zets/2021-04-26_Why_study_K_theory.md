# Why study $K$-theory?
Examples of results gleaned from the K-theory approach include the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, Bott periodicity, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and the Adams operations.

It played a major role in the second proof of the Index Theorem (circa 1962).

Already in 1955, Jean-Pierre Serre had used the analogy of vector bundles with projective modules to formulate Serre's conjecture, which states that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free;

Geometrically, finitely generated projective modules correspond to vector bundles over affine space, and free modules to trivial vector bundles. Affine space is topologically contractible, so It admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. It also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles. Jean-Pierre Serre remarked that the corresponding question was not known for algebraic vector bundles: "It is not known whether there exist projective A-modules of finite type which are not free." Here $A$ is a polynomial ring over a field, that is, $A$ = $k[x_1, ..., x_n]$. Theorem: every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free.

Note: another example of the use of the correspondence between isomorphism classes and cohomology

The Picard group of a ringed space X, denoted by Pic(X), is the group of isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves (or line bundles) on X. Alternatively, the Picard group can be defined as the sheaf cohomology group $H^{1} (X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X}^{*})$.
