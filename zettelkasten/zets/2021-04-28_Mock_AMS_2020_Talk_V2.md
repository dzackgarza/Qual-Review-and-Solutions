# Intro/Motivation

## Space, but Which One?

- You run into a "space" in the wild. Which one is it? 
- How many possible spaces *could* it be? 
- How much information is needed to specify our space uniquely?

---

## One Motivation: Physics

![Does your space have genus?](figures/SpaceWithGenus.png)

![Does your space have curvature or singularities?](figures/image_2020-07-31-01-53-20.png){ height=250px }

---


## Another Application: Data

![Can you only measure low-dimensional slices/projections?](figures/HighDimData.png)

- Possible to fit data to a high-dimensional manifold
- Makes clustering/grouping easier 
  - *(Here, slice with a hyperplane)*

---

![Does your space abstractly parameterize something else?](figures/ModuliSpace.png)

- Extract info about an entire family of objects and how they vary.
- Also useful for outlier detection!

---

## Where to Start

- What structure does your space have?
  
- What can you "measure" locally?

- How might it vary in ways you *can't* measure?

- Important question before attempting to classify:

  1. **What does "space" mean**?
    
    - Need to pick a category to work in.

  2. **What does "which" mean**?
    
    - How to distinguish? Need an equivalence relation!

--- 

# Q1: Types of Spaces

- Plan: compare classification theorem in topology and algebraic geometry
- Hopefully see some fun spaces along the way!
- But first: address classification and the notion of "sameness"

---

## The Greeks: Conics

- Early classification efforts: **conic sections**.
  - Apollonius, 190 BC, Ancient Greeks

- Key idea: realize as intersection loci in bigger space 

  - (Projectivize $\mathbb{R}^2$.)

![](figures/ConicSections.png){ height=400px }

---

- A conic is specified by 6 parameters:

\begin{align*} 
A x^{2}+B x y+C y^{2}+D x+E y+F=0 \\ \\
Q :=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
A & B / 2 & D / 2 \\
B / 2 & C & E / 2 \\
D / 2 & E / 2 & F
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{x} = [x, y, 1] \\ 
\implies \mathbf{x}^t Q \mathbf{x} = 0
\end{align*}

| $\det(Q)$ | Conic | 
| --- | --- |
| $<0$ | Hyperbola |
| $=0$ | Parabola |
| $>0$ | Ellipse |

---

- Each conic is a variety
  - Can obtain *every* conic by "modulating* 6 parameters.

- $\mathbb{R}^6$: too much information: scaling by a nonzero $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ yields the same conic, so reduce the space
  \[  
  [A, B, C, D, E, F]\in \mathbb{R}^6 \mapsto  [A: B: C: D: E: F] \in \mathbb{RP}^5
  .\]

- Important point: $\mathbb{RP}^5$ is a projective variety and a smooth manifold! Tools available:
  - Dimension (what does a generic point look like?)
  - Tangent and cotangent spaces, differential forms
  - Measures, metrics, volumes, integrals
  - Intersection theory (Bezout's Theorem!), subvarieties, curves
  - Linear algebra and Combinatorics (enumerative questions)


---

- We can imagine a *moduli space of conics* that parameterizes these:

![Moduli Space of Conics](figures/image_2020-07-31-03-22-18.png){ height=800px }

---

## Quadrics

Some Calc III review:

![Image](figures/QuadricChart.png){ height=650px }

---

General form:
\begin{array}{l}\scriptsize
A x^{2}+B y^{2}+C z^{2}+2 F y z+2 G z x+2 H x y+2 P x+2 Q y+2 R z +D=0 \\ \\
\text{Setting}\,\,
E:= \left[\begin{array}{llll}
A & H & Q & P \\
H & B & F & Q \\
G & F & C & R \\
P & Q & R & D
\end{array}\right]\,\,
e:= \left[\begin{array}{lll}
A & H & G \\
H & B & F \\
G & F & C
\end{array}\right] \\
\Delta := \operatorname{det}(E)
\end{array}

(discriminants), the equation becomes $\mathbf x^t E \mathbf x = 0$ and we have a classification:

> What is the moduli space? It sits inside $\mathbb{R}^{10}$, possibly $\mathbb{RP}^{9}$ but not in the literature!

---

## Automorphisms 

- Problem: infinitely many points in these moduli spaces correspond to the same "class" of conic

![Partition a Moduli Space](figures/image_2020-07-31-05-08-27.png){ height=500px }

---

- How to address: Klein's Erlangen program, understand the geometry of a space by understanding its structure-preserving automorphisms.

- For topological spaces: a Lie group acting on the space.

- Can then "mod out" by the appropriate morphisms to (hopefully) get finitely many equivalence classes



---

# What Does "Space" Mean?

---

## Some Setup

- **Algebraic Variety**: 
  Irreducible ,zero locus of some family $f\in \mathbb{k}[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ in $\mathbb{A}^n/\mathbb{k}$.
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ where $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of finite rational maps to $\mathbb{k}$.
- **Projective Variety**: 
  Irreducible zero locus of some family $f_n \subset \mathbb{k}[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ in $\mathbb{P}^n/\mathbb{k}$
  - Admits an embedding into $\mathbb{P}^\infty/\mathbb{k}$ as a closed subvariety.
- **Dimension** of a variety: the $n$ appearing above.

---

- **Topological Manifold**: Hausdorff, 2nd Countable, topological space, locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space where $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of continuous maps to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- **Smooth Manifold**: Topological manifold with a smooth structure (maximal smooth atlas) with $C^\infty$ transition functions.
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space where $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of smooth maps to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- **Algebraic Manifold**: A manifold that is also a variety, i.e. cut out by polynomial equations. 
  Example: $S^n$.

---

- Manifolds will be compact and without boundary, varieties are (probably) smooth, separated, of finite type.

---

## Impossible Goal

- Pick a category, understand *all* of the objects (identifying a moduli "space") and *all* of the maps.
  - Understand all topological spaces up to ???
    - Homeomorphism?
    - Diffeomorphism?
    - Homotopy-Equivalence?
    - Cobordism?
  - Understand all algebraic and/or projective varieties up to 
    - Biregular maps? 
    - Birational maps?
    - Locally ringed morphisms?

---

# Classification in Topology

---

## Topological Category

- Classifying manifolds up to homeomorphism: stratify "moduli space" of topological manifolds by dimension.

- Dimensions 0,1,2,3:
   - Smooth = Top. See smooth classification.

---

- Dimension 4: 
  - *Topologically* classified by surgery, but barely, and not smoothly.

![Surgery in Action](figures/image_2020-07-31-08-48-13.png){ height=600px }

---

- Dimension $n\geq 5$: 
  - Uniformly "classified" by surgery, s-cobordism, with a caveat:
  - $\pi_1$ can be any finitely presented group -- word problem
  - Instead, breaks homotopy type of a fixed manifold up into homeomorphism classes

![Surgery Classification](figures/SurgeryClassify.png){ height=500px }

---

## Smooth Category

Generally expect things to split into more classes.

- Dimension 0: The point (terminal object)
- Dimension 1: $\mathbb{S}^1, \mathbb{R}^1$

---

- Dimension 2: $\left\langle\mathbb{S}^2, \mathbb{T}^2, \mathbb{RP}^2 \mid \mathbb{S}^2 = 0,\,\,3\mathbb{RP}^2 = \mathbb{RP}^2 + \mathbb{T}^2 \right\rangle$. 
  - Classified by $\pi_1$ (orientability and "genus"). 
    Riemann, Poincaré, Klein.

![](figures/Connect.png){ height=500px }

---

- Dimension 2: closed + orientable $\implies$ complex
  - **Uniformization**: Holomorphically equivalent to a quotient of one of three spaces/geometries:
    - $\mathbb{CP}^1$, positive curvature (spherical)   
    - $\mathbb{C}$, zero curvature (flat, Euclidean)
    - $\mathbb{H}$ (equiv. $\mathbb{D}^\circ$), negative curvature (hyperbolic)
  - Stratified by genus 
    - Genus 0: Only $\mathbb{CP}^1$
    - Genus 1: All of the form $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$, with a distinguished point $[0]$, i.e. an elliptic curve.
      - Has a topological group structure!
    - Genus $\geq 2$: Complicated?

> Doesn't capture holomorphy type completely.

---

## 3-manifolds: Thurston's Geometrization

- Geometric structure: a diffeo $M\cong \tilde M/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a discrete Lie group acting freely/transitively on $X$ (as in Erlangen program)
- Decompose into pieces with one of 8 geometries: 
  - Spherical $\sim S^3$
  - Euclidean $\sim \mathbb{R}^3$
  - Hyperbolic $\sim \mathbb{H}^3$
  - $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$
  - $\mathbb{H}^2\times \mathbb{R}$
  - $\widetilde{\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})}$
  - "Nil"
  - "Sol"

---

- Proved by Perelman 2003, Ricci flow with surgery.

![Ricci Flow with Surgery](figures/Ricci.png)

---

![More Ricci Flow](figures/MoreRicci.png)

---


- 4-manifolds: classified in the topological category by surgery, but not in the smooth category
  - Hard! Will examine special cases of Calabi-Yau
  - Open part of Poincaré Conjecture.
- Dimension $\geq 5$: surgery theory, strong relation between diffeomorphic and s-cobordant.

---


## Toward Algebraic Manifolds: Berger's Classification

- Every smooth manifold admits a Riemannian metric, so consider Riemannian manifolds

- Here $H\leq \mathrm{SO}(n)$ is the *holonomy* group:

![Holonomy](figures/holonomyFold.png){ height=375px }

---

- Berger's classification for smooth Riemannian manifolds, one of 7 possibilities.
$$
\tiny
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline n=\operatorname{dim} M & H & \text { Parallel tensors } & \text { Name } & \text { Curvature } \\
\hline n & \mathrm{SO}(n) & g, \mu & \text {orientable} & \\
\hline 2 m(m \geq 2) & \mathrm{U}(m) & g, \omega & \textbf{Kähler} & \\
\hline 2 m(m \geq 2) & \mathrm{SU}(m) & g, \omega, \Omega & \textbf{Calabi-Yau} & \text {Ricci-flat} \\
\hline 4 m(m \geq 2) & \mathrm{Sp}(m) & g, \omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3}, J_{1}, J_{2}, J_{3} & \textbf{hyper-Kähler} & \text {Ricci-flat} \\
\hline 4 m(m \geq 2) & (\mathrm{Sp}(m) \times \mathrm{Sp}(1)) / \mathbb{Z}_{2} & g, \Upsilon & \text {quaternionic-Kähler} & \text {Einstein} \\
\hline 7 & \mathrm{G}_{2} & g, \varphi, \psi & \mathrm{G}_{2} & \text {Ricci-flat} \\
\hline 8 & \operatorname{Spin}(7) & g, \Phi & \operatorname{Spin}(7) & \text {Ricci-flat} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

> Types in bold: amenable to Algebraic Geometry.
> $G2$ shows up in Physics!

- Ricci-flat, i.e. Ricci curvature tensor vanishes 
  - *(Measures deviation of volumes of "geodesic balls" from Euclidean balls of the same radius)*

# Classification in Algebraic Geometry

## Enriques-Kodaira Classification

> Work over $\mathbb{C}$ for simplicity, take all dimensions over $\mathbb{C}$.

- Minimal model program: classifying complex projective varieties.

- Stratify the "moduli space" of varieties by $\mathbb{k}-$dimension.

- Dimension 1:
  - Smooth Algebraic curves = compact Riemann surfaces, classified by genus
  - Roughly known by Riemann: moduli space of smooth projective curves $\mathcal{M}_g$ is a connected open subset of a projective variety of dimension $3g-3$.

> We'll come back to these!

---

- Dimension 2:
  - Smooth Algebraic Surfaces: Hard. 
    See Enriques classification.
    
  - Setting of classical theorem: always 27 lines on a cubic surface! 

  - Example Clebsch surface, satisfies the system
  \[  
  \begin{array}{l}
  x_{0}+x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}=0 \\ \\
  x_{0}^{3}+x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}+x_{4}^{3}=0
  \end{array}
  \]

---

## Interesting Space: Elliptic Curves

- Equivalently, Riemann surfaces with one marked point.
- Equivalently, $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ a lattice, where homothetic lattices (multiplication by  $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}- \{0\}$) are equivalent.
- Generalize to $\mathbb{C}^n/\Lambda$ to obtain *abelian varieties*.

---

![Complex Curves as Real Surfaces](figures/image_2020-07-31-08-51-42.png){ height=300px }

---

## Interesting Space: Moduli of Elliptic Curves

- $\mathcal{M}_g$: the moduli space of compact Riemann surfaces (curves) of genus $g$, i.e. elliptic curves.

![Approximately the Actual Space](figures/CloserToTheActualSpace.png){ height=400px }

---

## Dimension 2: Algebraic Surfaces

---

![Generalize to Moduli Space of Surfaces?](figures/image_2020-07-31-09-04-43.png){ height=750px }

---

- Definition: **Kodaira Dimension** 

  - $X$ has some canonical sheaf $\omega_X$, you can take some sheaf cohomology and get a sequence of integers (*plurigenera*)

\begin{align*}
P_{\mathbf{n}} (X) &:= h^0(X, \omega_X^{\otimes \mathbf{n}}) \quad n\in \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0} \\ \\
\implies \kappa(X) &:= \limsup_{\mathbf n \to \infty} {\log P_{\mathbf n}(X) \over \log(\mathbf{n})  }
\end{align*}

---

## Dimension 2: Algebraic Surfaces

Every such surface has a minimal model of one of 10 types:

$\kappa = -\infty$ (2 main types)

- 1. Rational: $\cong \mathbb{CP}^2$
- 2. Ruled: $\cong X$ for $\mathbb{CP}^1 \to X \to C$ a bundle over a curve.
  
  - Called "ruled" because every point is on some $\mathbb{CP}^1$.
- 3. Type VII

---

![Our Old Friend the Hyperboloid](figures/Hyperboloid.jpg){ height=700px }

---

$\kappa = 0$ (Elliptic-ish, 4 types)

- 4. Enriques (all (quasi)-elliptic fibrations)
- 5. Hyperelliptic
  - Taking Albanese embedding (generalizes Jacobian for curves) yields an elliptic fibration 
    - *(i.e. a surface bundle, potentially with singular fibers)*
- 6. $K3$ (Kummer-Kahler-Kodaira) surfaces
- 7. Toric and Abelian Surfaces:
  - 2 dimensional abelian varieties (projective algebraic variety + algebraic group structure).
  - Compare to 1 dimensional case: all 1d complex torii are algebraic varieties, 
    - Riemann discovered that most 2d torii are *not*.
- 8. Kodaira Surfaces 

---

$\kappa = 1$: Other elliptic surfaces

9. Properly quasi-elliptic.

> Elliptic fibration, but almost all fibers have a node.

$\kappa = 2$ (Max possible, "everything else")

10. General type


# Interesting Space: Toric Varieties
- Definitions:
  - Define a *complex torus* as $\mathbb{T} = (\mathbb{C}^{\times})^n \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$
  - Can be written as the zero set of some $f\in \mathbb{C}[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$.
    
    > Generalizes to algebraic groups over a field: $(\mathbb{G}_m)^n$ (analogy: maximal torus/Cartan subalgebra in Lie theory)
  
  - **Toric variety**: $X$ contains a dense Zariski-open torus $\mathbb{T}$, where the action of $\mathbb{T}$ on itself as a group extends to $X$.

---

![The Wide World of Polytopes](figures/ConvexPolyhedra.png){ height=700px }

---

- Flavor: spaces modeled on convex polyhedra
- Examples: bundles over $\mathbb{CP}^n$.
- Why study:
  - Model spaces by rigid geometry, generalize things like Bezier curves
    - Some are determined by rigid combinatorial data ("fan", or polytopes)
    - Combinatorial data for constructions in mirror symmetry, e.g. Calabi-Yaus (1/2 of one billion threefolds!)

---

## Kahler Manifolds/Varieties

- As complex manifolds:
  - A symplectic manifold $(X, \omega)$ with an integrable almost-complex structure $J$ compatible with $\omega$.
  - Yields an inner product on tangent vectors: $g(u, v) := \omega(u, Jv)$ (i.e. a metric)

![](figures/SpecialKahler.png){ height=400px }

---

- Examples: *all* smooth complex projective varieties
  - But not all complex manifolds (exception: Stein manifolds)
- Specialize to Calabi-Yaus: compact, Ricci-flat, trivial canonical.
  - Calabi's Conjecture and Yau's field medal: existence of Ricci-flat Kahlers (Calabi-Yaus) 

> Trivial canonical $\implies$ exists a nowhere vanishing top form = top wedge of $T^* X$ is the trivial line bundle

---

## Calabi-Yau

- Another from Berger's classification, special case of Kahler

![Calabi-Yau "Strings"](figures/Calabi.png){ height=600px }


---

- Applications: Physicists want to study $G_2$ manifolds (an exceptional Lie group, automorphisms of octonions)
  - Part of $M$-theory uniting several superstring theories, but no smooth or complex structures. 
  - Indirect approach: compactify an 11-dimension space, one small $S^1$ dimension $\to$ 10 dimensions
    - 4 spacetime and 6 "small" Calabi-Yau
  - Superstring theory: a bundle over spacetime with fibers equal to Calabi-Yaus. 
  
> *Roughly*, genera of fibers will correspond to families of observed particles.

---

## Calabi-Yaus

- As manifolds: 
  - Ricci-flat: vacuum solutions to (analogs of) Einstein's equations with zero cosmological constant
  - Setting for mirror symmetry: the symplectic geometry of a Calabi-Yau is "the same" as the complex geometry of its mirror.

  - Yau, Fields Medal 1982: There are Ricci flat but non-flat (nontrivial holonomy) projective complex manifolds of dimensions $\geq 2$.

--- 

- As varieties: the canonical bundle $\Lambda^n T^* V$ is trivial

- Compact classification for $\mathbb{C}-$dimension:
  - Dimension 1: 1 type, all elliptic curves (up to homeomorphism)
  - Dimension 2: 1 type, $K3$ surfaces

---

- Dimension 3: (threefolds) conjectured to be a bounded number, but unknown.
  - At least 473,800,776!
