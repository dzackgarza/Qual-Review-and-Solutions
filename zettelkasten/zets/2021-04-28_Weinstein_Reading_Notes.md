[Stein Manifolds](../Subjects/Stein%20Manifolds.md)

Goal: set up Stein and Weinstein cobordisms, get a Weinstein analog of the h-cobordism theorem.

Supporting concepts

- Normal forms of functions near critical points
- Vector fields near zeros (?)
- Lyapunov pairs: a function and a gradient-like vector field
- Smale cobordisms and homotopies
- Elementary cobordisms
- Profiles and holonomy


- Review Classical h-cobordism theorem
- Morse Lemma: Nondegenerate index $k$ for $\phi: M^n \to \RR$ implies $\phi(u) = \phi(p) - \vector{u}_k^t A \vector{u}_{n-k}$
- Definitions: embryonic, birth-death types, Cerf diagram
- Theorem: Critical points in 1-parameter families of diffeos are nondegenerate and only birth-death type
- Definition: Morse index
- Definition: Stable and unstable manifolds
- Definition: Lyapnuov functions
